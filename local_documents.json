A\nportal user can access the\u00a0modules and\u00a0some of the associated data that they have been given access to, such as\nproducts, invoices, and notes present in CRM. They can also view, edit records, create records, and add notes.\nBusiness cases\u00a0\nLet us consider a few scenarios to understand how portals can be helpful in your business.\nIn a franchise \u00a0- Imagine you run a fast food business and have granted others the right to operate the\nfranchise in a few locations. You use Zoho CRM to manage all the business details and to track outlets'\nperformance. The franchise owners can request to view their outlets' performance and their customers'\nNote:\u00a0\nUsers with portal access can create, edit, delete notes, attach files or delete attachments to the notes\nas part of portal activity. However, they cannot add, view, edit, or delete attachments as a seperate\nrelated list to the record shared via portals.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/portals/articles/setting-up-portal\ndetails.\u00a0You can create exclusive portals for the franchise owners. They will be able to view and edit the\nrelevant records right\u00a0from the CRM.\nIn the automobile industry\u00a0 - For example, you have an automobile shop and want to track your customers'\ndetails, your sold vehicles and servicing schedules. To do this, you can create a portal and share it with your\nclients. The customers can view and edit their details in the portal, and they will be updated in your CRM\nrecords. Similarly, if they want to get their vehicle serviced, they can fill in their details using the portal.\nIn an educational institute \u00a0- If you run a school, instead of manually entering every student's details, you\ncan provide\u00a0parents with access to the portal's. They can add, update, or view their child's details in the portal\nand share the students' grades and performance scores with the parents through the portal.\nFor business partners \u00a0- You run a software company and use CRM to follow up with your contacts and\nleads or to track\u00a0multiple deals that are at different stages. There is a meeting with the partners and you want\nto discuss all the contacts and the\u00a0deals that have the highest revenue. Imagine how tedious it would be to\nshare this complex information with individual partners. You can easily manage this situation by creating a\nportal for the partners, where you give them access to the\u00a0Contacts module and add a contact lookup in\nthe\u00a0Deals module in CRM. This will enable them to view the contacts and their associated deals and add or\nremove details in the modules based on their permissions.\nAvailability\nPricing related to your Portal\nHere are a few details about portal-related pricing and the number of portal user types that can be created.\nYou can configure up to\u00a0five\u00a0portal user types. The first portal user type is free and can be created only for\nthe\u00a0Contacts\u00a0module.\u00a0\nThe additional four portal user types need to be purchased. These can be created for the\u00a0Leads,\u00a0Contacts,\nVendors,\u00a0and\u00a0Custom\u00a0modules.\u00a0\u00a0\nFirst portal user type- The first portal user type is added by default. You can invite up to 10,000\u00a0users of\nthis portal type (Contacts) for free. Please contact\u00a0support@zohocrm.com\u00a0if you need to add more users.\u00a0\nFour additional portal user types - For adding more portal user types, you need to purchase portal user\nlicenses. Each user license costs $5/month.\nFor example, for 100 portal users, the price will be $500/month ($5 x 100).\nPermission Required\u00a0\nUsers with the Manage Portal Profile permission can create a portal and invite customers.\nCheck Feature Availability and Limits\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/portals/articles/setting-up-portal\nActions that a portal user can perform\nCreate, edit or delete records - They can create, edit or delete records in the CRM module to which they have\naccess.\u00a0\nEdit associated records -\u00a0A portal user can edit records that are associated with them, that are added by other\nCRM users, if they have the required permission. For example, if a deal or account is associated with the portal\nuser then he can edit the details of those records.\u00a0\nEdit information in a record -\u00a0They can edit the fields (even the ones present in subforms) on a record that is\nshared with them, for example address, phone number, email address etc. The changes will reflect in the CRM.\u00a0\nClone records associated with the leads/contacts (deals, invoices, quotes, etc.)\u00a0-\u00a0They can clone other records\nthat are associated with them and add more details as required. For example, if a portal user wants to replicate a\ndeal, quote or invoice, then instead of creating a new record from scratch they can clone an existing record and\nmake edits wherever necessary.\u00a0\nPortal for trial edition\nThe Enterprise and Ultimate trial edition users can configure and use portal for the 30-day trial period. Once\nconfigured, the system-defined portal user type for the Contacts module will be created to which they can add a\u00a0\nmaximum of 10 users.\u00a0\nNew portal user types cannot be created in the trial edition.\nIn case, the trial account is not upgraded to Enterprise or Ultimate paid edition the following actions will be taken:\nIf you subscribe to Standard or Professional paid editions then the portal created in the trial edition will be\nretained.\nIf you subscribe to Free edition then the portal details will be deleted after 30 days.\nSetting up portal\nSetting up a portal involves the following four steps:\nCreating a portal\nDefining portal user type\nConfiguring portal type\nSpecifying field permissions\nCreating a portal\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/portals/articles/setting-up-portal\nBy default, your company's name will be taken as the portal name and it will be used to generate a URL, that your\ncustomers will use to access the portal. You can change the portal name while creating the portal. You can edit the\nportal URL if needed.\nAlso, if the portal name is already in use, Zoho CRM will prompt you to change it.\nTo create a portal\n1. Go to\u00a0 Setup \u00a0>\u00a0 Channels \u00a0>\u00a0 Portals .\n2. In the\u00a0Portals\u00a0page, click\u00a0Get Started Now.\nYour company's name will appear as the default portal name.\n3.

The admin must notify the portal users about the URL change so\nthey continue unhindered portal access.\nDefining Portal user type\nUser type is a label for the users who will be accessing the CRM modules via portal. Permissions can be defined\nfor the user types that will enable or restrict access to the data in the CRM account. Some examples of portal user\ntypes are: vendors, clients, consultants, customers, partners, or resellers.\nTo define a portal user type\n1. Under\u00a0Portal User Type\u00a0enter a name e.g., parents, partners or service agents etc.\nNote\nWhen you create a portal, a default portal user type called\u00a0 Client Portal \u00a0will be created that cannot\nbe deleted. You can add up to 10,000 users without payment. To add more users you need to\npurchase. You can only add clients or customers to this portal, you will not be able to add users from\nthe same domain, i.e., your employees or partners.\nNote that, the new URL must be shared with the portal users manually to\u00a0avoid portal access issues.\nThere will be NO automatic notification sent to the portal users regarding change of access URL.\u00a0\u00a0\nPlease note that the first portal user type must be a customer only. Therefore, you cannot add a user from\nthe same domain like your employees in the first portal user type.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/portals/articles/setting-up-portal\n2. Click\u00a0Next.\nConfiguring the portal tab\nIn this step, you will choose the modules and the specific layouts or wizards that the portal user will be able to\naccess and define permissions to either create, edit, view, or delete records. For example, you run a car company\nand want your clients to enter\u00a0some information.\u00a0You can configure a portal exclusively for these clients and give\nthem access to the\u00a0Leads module. The clients can enter their details in the portal to be added to their CRM record.\nConfiguring the portal tab includes the following steps:\n1. Choose the module:\u00a0You can choose to give the customers access to the\u00a0Leads,\u00a0Contacts, Vendors or\ncustom modules. The customers will be able to view their own details in the module and based on their\npermissions, they may be able to add and edit records.\n2. Select the related modules: Related modules are modules that are connected through lookup or multi-\nselect lookup fields to the module containing your portal users. For example, the Deals module is associated\nwith Contacts through a lookup field. Therefore, when creating a portal for contacts, Deals will be available\nas a related module, and you can grant users access to it. You have the option to choose any related module\nthat you want customers to engage with.\na. Select the layouts of the related modules:\u00a0You can choose one or more layouts, as well as the\nwizards available for those layouts for the portal users to access.\nb. Define the module record permission:\u00a0You can set the permission level for each record in a module.\nFor example, you can allow the clients to view or edit their\u00a0license number or mailing address, or give\na vendor read-only permission to purchase orders.\nc. Select list view:\u00a0If you have created a canvas view for any CRM module, you can choose either\u00a0List\nview or\u00a0Canvas view\u00a0to display a record.\u00a0List view will be selected by default for all modules.\nNote that the custom buttons or custom links will not be displayed for the portal users if they\nare added to the\u00a0Canvas or List view.\nd. Filter By: You can select the records visible to portal users by filtering them via lookup or multi-\nselect lookup fields. For example, in the Deals module, if there are two Contact lookup fields - one\nfor choosing the customer organization's manager (Manager field) and the other for selecting the\neconomic decision maker (Decision maker field) - the portal for managers can filter records using the\nManager field while the portal for decision makers can have the records filtered by the Decision\nmaker field.\n3. Select Public Modules: Portal users can access modules designated as Public read only or Public\nread/write/delete (through data sharing settings). These modules will be listed under the Public Modules\nsection, allowing users to view records within them.

Select Web Tabs: As an organization, you may have a few customers who access your crm with the help of\nportals. In addition to viewing the modules and its related records, they can get access to the web tabs as\nwell.

They can share this web tab with the stakeholders via portal to provide quick access and easy\nnavigation from within CRM.

Click\u00a0Save.\nThe Lawful Bases\nThe fundamental principle\u00a0for handling personal data is\u00a0that data\u00a0must be processed\u00a0lawfully and in a transparent\nmanner.\u00a0GDPR\u00a0defines six lawful bases to process data. It is important to understand\u00a0all of them as\u00a0 no\u00a0one lawful\nbasis is\u00a0better than the others. Choosing the most appropriate basis\u00a0depends on the purpose of data processing and\nyour business requirements.\nConsent\u00a0- When you have consent from the data subject to process their personal data. There\u00a0must be a\ndeliberate action\u00a0on the part of the data subject to opt in or give consent.\nExample: Collecting and processing personal data for marketing purposes\u00a0or for sending newsletters.\nContract\u00a0- When you have a contract with an individual to supply goods or services\u00a0requested by them. In\nthis case, you process data to fulfill the contract.\nExample: During a contract, when the customer asks for more information via email, the organization\nprocesses their personal data to respond to the request.\nLegal Obligation\u00a0- When you have to process the data to comply\u00a0with the law.\nExample: An employee's salary details are needed by a government institution or\u00a0an investigation requires the\nprocessing of the personal data.\nVital Interests\u00a0- When you\u00a0need to process data to\u00a0protect someone's life or in\u00a0an emergency situation.\nExample:\u00a0Collecting\u00a0personal details of the people to ensure their safety during an emergency or a fire.\nPublic Tasks\u00a0- When you need to carry out\u00a0tasks in the public interest, usually as a\u00a0government institution,\npolitical party, etc.\nExample: As a public authority\u00a0who processes data for\u00a0scientific research, surveys, or public health studies.\nLegitimate Interests\u00a0- When your organization holds a genuine, legitimate reason to process data and the\npurpose does not harm the data subject's rights.\nExample: A\u00a0customer has not paid their invoice and so the company needs to process the customer's data to\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/compliance-setting/gdpr/articles/managing-lawful-bases-for\n-data-processing\ncollect payment.\u00a0Or, for administrative purposes, when an organization processes\u00a0an employees' personal data\nfor payroll.\nApplying Lawful Bases with Zoho CRM\nLawful basis as\u00a0Not Applicable.\nBy default, all the records in the\u00a0Leads,\u00a0Contacts, and\u00a0Vendors modules will have the\u00a0Data Processing Basis\u00a0set\nto\u00a0Not Applicable when you enable GDPR from\u00a0Setup\u00a0>\u00a0Users andControl\u00a0>\u00a0Compliance Settings.\u00a0Once this is\nenabled, each record will have a\u00a0Data Privacy\u00a0section\u00a0with the data processing basis details. You can change\u00a0this\nbased on your discretion and business cases.\nData Privacy section for records\nOnce GDPR is switched on in your Zoho CRM account, each record will have a\u00a0Data Privacy\u00a0section where the\ndata processing basis details are available.\u00a0If\u00a0Consent\u00a0is the lawful basis, the options to send\u00a0a\u00a0consent form and\nupdate consent details manually\u00a0will also be available. A new field called\u00a0Source\u00a0in the record's details page will\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/compliance-setting/gdpr/articles/managing-lawful-bases-for\n-data-processing\nalso be available, which\u00a0will store the data sources such as Web forms, APIs, Integrations, etc.\u00a0\nWho can access Data Privacy section for records.\nAny user who has the permission to view the record will be able to view\u00a0and edit the\u00a0Data Processing Basis\nsection. If you use portals and the data processing basis is\u00a0Consent, people who have access to the portal, will be\nable to see the\u00a0Data Privacy\u00a0section. They can update their consent details.\nWhen\u00a0Consent\u00a0is the lawful basis\nIf your business is running on Zoho CRM, you can process data based on\u00a0any of the lawful bases mentioned\nearlier. Consent\u00a0requires a deliberate action to opt in\u00a0on the part of the subject matter.\u00a0It is therefore mandatory for\nthe controller to keep a proper consent management system in place to\u00a0obtain consent from the data subjects.\nZoho CRM's consent management system helps you obtain consent from your prospects and customers.\nConsent management in Zoho CRM has the following options.\nDefine Consent Settings\nSet up the consent form\nAdd consent link in email template\nView the status of consent request\nChange lawful basis for records.\nYou can change\u00a0the lawful data processing\u00a0basis in the following ways:\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/compliance-setting/gdpr/articles/managing-lawful-bases-for\n-data-processing\nSelect an individual record and update the details under\u00a0Data Privacy.\nCreate a list view to filter out the records and click the\u00a0More\u00a0icon >\u00a0Update Data Processing Basis.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/compliance-setting/gdpr/articles/managing-lawful-bases-for\n-data-processing\nCreate a workflow rule to automate the process of updating lawful basis for records that met\u00a0certain\u00a0criteria.\nUse the\u00a0Data Processing Basis\u00a0field\u00a0to define the criteria.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/compliance-setting/gdpr/articles/managing-lawful-bases-for\n-data-processing\nView Details and History\nYou can view the details of the Data Processig Basis chosen for a particular data subject.

Record locking is\na configuration that allows you to lock those records manually or automatically when certain conditions are met.\n\u00a0\nScenario 1\nLet's say a deal has reached the final stage, or has been closed won or lost. The records for the deal, like the deal\namount, discount offered, or the quotes exchanged, should not be edited. You can configure record locking for the\ndeals module such that once a record reaches a certain stage it will be locked.\n\u00a0\nScenario 2\nLet's say a record is in proposal review. During that stage, the record details will be verified. Even though a sales\nrepresentative may be the owner of the record, you cannot allow them to update the records while the review is\nongoing, as these details will be considered for rating. This is when you can set up locking as well.\n\u00a0\nScenario 3\nThere can also be scenarios where the quotes can still be edited by the accounts team but be restricted from edits\nof any other profile. These records can simply be locked for all other profiles except the profile for the users\nwithin the accounts team.\nLocking Configuration\u00a0\nYou can set up the locking configuration for different modules to lock records manually or automatically.\n\u00a0\nThere can also be situations when the record doesn't match the criteria, but the user dealing with the record can\ndecide to lock the record to avoid changes. In such cases, they can manually lock it and decide when to unlock it\nlater.\n\u00a0\nHowever, even when the record is locked, a few fields that do not affect the business process can be left editable.\nFor example, in the case of closed deals, the Description field or Comments fields can be left editable\nAvailability\nPermission Required\nUsers with Customize Modules permission can configure record locking for a module.\nCheck Feature Availability and Limits\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/record-level-customization/articles/record-locking-configuration-and-usage\nAutomatic locking\u00a0\nUpon enabling automatic locking:\nYou can set up\u00a0to\u00a0five rules per module.

Click Lock.\nThe behaviour of Locked Records\u00a0\nRecord Details page: On the Record Details page, a lock icon will be shown with the record image, as well\nas on the UI of the record detail page you will see \"Record is locked\" along with the options to check details\nabout the locking, and the option to unlock.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/record-level-customization/articles/record-locking-configuration-and-usage\nThe timeline of the record will also show the locking details.\nList View: \u00a0On the list view, locked records will be shown with a lock icon.\nAdditionally, you can filter records on the list view based on the pre-defined filter option, as well as use the\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/record-level-customization/articles/record-locking-configuration-and-usage\nsystem-defined custom view.\nNotes:\nThe system-defined custom view and filter option will only fetch records that are locked according\nto the record-locking configuration.\nYou can mass update locked records if the fields to be updated are allowed to modify in the record-\nlocking configuration.\nIf you delete the rule in the record locking configuration, the records locked through those rules\nwill be unlocked automatically. If the locking configuration is deleted, all the records in the module\nwill be unlocked.\nWhen an org is downgraded to lower editions of Zoho CRM, the locked records will be\nautomatically unlocked; the locked status cannot be regained upon upgrade.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/record-level-customization/articles/record-locking-configuration-and-usage\nSpecial Cases\u00a0\nAutomation effect on locked records\u00a0\nLocked records can still go through automated processes like workflow, Assignment rules,\nApproval processes, and Scoring rules when the locked record is triggered for specific rules. This\ncan happen when a user who has permission to update locked records triggers these processes. This\nis to ensure that the data behaves as per the configured automated rules.\nLet's assume there is a workflow rule that is configured such that a field update happens to the\nrecords on record creation or update. In this case, if a user who is excluded from Record locking\nedits the record that is locked for other users, the corresponding field update triggers.\nThe same thing happens for other automation features as well.\n\u00a0\nBlueprint cases\u00a0\u00a0\nA record that already entered a Blueprint can still be locked automatically if it satisfied the lock\nrule criteria. In such a case, the blueprint transitions will be hidden in the details page of the record.\n\u00a0A user who has permission to edit locked records can perform the transitions if they are eligible as\nper the respective Blueprint configuration.\n\u00a0\nIntegration sync\u00a0\nIn a few of the Organization level integrations, there can be sync between records of both products.\nFor example, integration with Zoho Desk allows you to set up contact sync between Zoho CRM\nand Zoho Desk.\nIn such cases, if a contact that is locked in CRM is updated in Zoho Desk, the update happens in\nCRM too. This is followed to make sure that the data is always consistent on both ends.\nAt the same time, locked records will still be pushed to Zoho Desk from CRM.\nOther examples of the same flow- are Zoho Projects and Zoho Finance Suite.\nIn user-specific integrations like Google contact sync and Microsoft sync, the locked records will\nnot be pushed to the integrated product if the user using their account for such sync, is not excluded\nfrom locking.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/record-level-customization/articles/record-locking-configuration-and-usage\nPoints to remember\nRelated list records can still be associated with locked records. There will be no restriction for\nRelated list associations.\nHowever, locked records cannot be associated as Related list records for a normal parent record.\nWhen a record is associated through a related list, the corresponding lookup field gets updated.\nHowever, since the record is locked, the corresponding lookup field should not be updated. Hence,\nlocked records cannot be associated through Related lists.\nIf the corresponding lookup field is allowed to be modified as per record locking configuration, this\nassociation can happen without any restriction.\n", "source": "record-locking-configuration-and-usage.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "multiple-currencies", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/organization-settings/company-settings/articles/multiple-currencies\nZoho Corporation\nManage Multiple Currencies\nThe multi-currency support in Zoho CRM helps you to handle business transactions in the global marketplace easily. If you\nregularly deal with international clients and vendors, then Multi-Currency will facilitate international buying and selling. With\nMulti-Currency support in Zoho CRM, you can:\nEstimate the value of an opportunity using the currency you deal in and also in the customer's local currency.\nGenerate and view reports in your organization's currency.\nImport a single file that contains data with values in multiple currencies.\nAvailability\nPoints to Remember\nWhen a user transitions from a paid edition to a trial edition, they can utilize currencies up to the limits of their original paid\nedition without disabling any added currencies. However, upon moving to an edition with lower limits, the constraints of the\nlower edition will apply, potentially preventing the addition or activation of currencies if the limit is exceeded.\nThe free edition does not support multiple currencies. Downgrading to the free edition results in the deactivation of all\npreviously added currencies. Upon upgrading to a higher edition, users must manually activate currencies to resume their use.\nOverall benefits of using multi-currencies\nImproved customer experience: Customers can make payments in their preferred currency, which enhances their experience\nand boosts customer satisfaction.\u00a0\nIncreased sales: By enabling customers to make purchases in their local currency, businesses can expand their reach and gain\nnew customers, resulting in increased sales and revenue.\u00a0\nGlobal reach: Businesses can expand their operations globally, allowing them to sell products or services to customers in\ndifferent currencies. Accepting payments in multiple currencies removes barriers to entry and enables businesses to tap into\nnew markets.\u00a0\nAccurate pricing: Ensures that pricing is accurate and consistent across different currencies, preventing confusion and errors\nin pricing that can negatively impact sales.\u00a0\nCurrency conversion: Automatically converts currencies, making it easy for businesses to manage payments without having\nto convert currencies manually or use a third-party tool.\u00a0\nTerminologies in currencies feature\nHome Currency\nIt is the primary currency that your organization uses for its business.

For example, a company has offices in Japan, India, and Spain, but its headquarters are in the US. So, the financial\nfigures of this company are expressed in terms of US Dollars. In the example, the Home Currency is US dollars.\nActive Currency\nThese are the currencies in which your organization does business.

Once deactivated, these currencies will not be deleted. They will still\nbe listed under Currencies.\nExchange Rates\nIt is the rate at which one currency can be exchanged for another. In your CRM account the exchange rate is used to convert an\namount in one currency to the home currency used by your organization.\nRecord Currency\nThis is the currency for each record.

These fields will be available to all the users added to your organization's\nCRM account.\nCustomize Zoho Defined Fields : You can edit, delete and hide some of Zoho defined fields, but note that there are some fields that you cannot delete,\nremove, rename or change from mandatory settings. These Zoho defined fields are mandatory in Zoho CRM. For example, Last Name in Leads, Subject in\nTasks etc.\nSet Field Access Permissions : \u00a0You can hide the fields for users in a specific profile or mark the fields as Read Only.\nAvailability\nPermission Required\nUsers with the\u00a0Customize Zoho CRM\u00a0permission in profile can access this feature.\nMulti-line fields\nIn Zoho CRM, a multi-line field is a type of custom field that allows users to enter multiple lines of text. This feature is particularly useful for capturing detailed\ninformation that cannot be sufficiently conveyed in a single line. Here are some key aspects of the multi-line field in Zoho CRM:\nFlexibility for detailed information: Multi-line fields are ideal for entering descriptions, notes, or any other information that requires more space than a\nstandard single-line text field.\nCustomization: Like other fields in Zoho CRM, multi-line fields can be customized according to the specific needs of your business. You can set\ncharacter limits and control which sections or layouts they appear in.\nApplications: These fields are commonly used in areas like customer support, where detailed customer queries or issues need to be recorded, or in sales,\nwhere detailed product descriptions or client requirements are noted.\nEffortless compatibility: Multi-line fields can be seamlessly incorporated into your CRM's operational processes, ensuring that the gathered data blends\neffortlessly with other components of your CRM system.\nUser interface: The multi-line field provides a user-friendly text box which can be easily accessed and edited by CRM users, ensuring a smooth user\nexperience.\nMulti-line fields can be configured in three formats: Plain Text Small, Plain Text Large, and Rich Text format.\nMulti-line field type\nCharacter limit\nMandatory field option\nEncryption\nTooltips\nPlain text small\nUpto 2000\nYes\nYes\nYes\nPlain text large\nUpto 32000\nYes\nNo\nYes\nRich text (RTF)\nUpto 50000\nNo\nNo\nYes\nPlain Text Small Field\nNote\nThe maximum number of fields that you can create in each Edition varies. Similarly, there is also a maximum limit for each type of field that you\ncreate.\u00a0See Also\u00a0 Custom Field Limits\nYou can rename the custom fields but you cannot change the Field Type (eg. Text, Integer, Date, etc.) of the custom fields.\nFor instance, if you create a Text field, you cannot change the same to an Integer field.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/types-of-fields\nThis field type is ideal for entries that require a concise format, with a character limit set to 2,000. Its primary advantage lies in its array of features - it can be\nconfigured as a mandatory field, ensuring that crucial data is always captured. Additionally, for heightened data security, this field type supports encryption. To\nassist users in understanding the kind of data expected in these fields, tooltips can be added, providing on-spot guidance and information.\nPlain Text Large Field\nDesigned for more extensive data entry, the Plain Text Large field accommodates up to 32,000 characters. This makes it suitable for in-depth descriptions or\nlengthy notes where detailed information is essential. It is important to note, however, that this field type does not support encryption, and it can be set as\nmandatory and can have tooltips added.\nRich Text Field\nThe Rich Text field is the preferred choice when there is a need for formatted text and a larger character limit. It can accommodate up to 50,000 characters,\nincluding HTML elements that are generated when the text is formatted, making it ideal for entries that require styling and organization, such as product\nNote:\nPlain Text Large fields are not supported in filters and criteria.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/types-of-fields\ndescriptions or detailed client communications. Although tooltips can be added to improve user interaction, the rich text field does not support encryption or\nmandatory input settings.\nUsing rich text can improve the visual appeal of your information by providing different font styles, colors, and highlights. This allows for effective\ncommunication of important details. Bullet points and numbered lists can enhance readability, while bold, italics, or underlined texts can emphasize crucial\ninformation. Increased and decreased indents can help organize data, and the strikethrough feature can easily indicate changes or updates.\nSpecifics and characteristics\nHere are the key details of rich text multi-line fields:\nComprehensive Text Editor: The text editor that comes with rich text multi-line fields offers a wide range of essential and additional editing options.\nThe available format options for rich text multi-line fields are as follows:\nBold, Italics, Underline, Strikethrough, Text colors, Background color, Bullets, Numbering, URL, Indent options, Subscript, Superscript, Emojis, Clear\nformatting\nExpanded Text Box: The record details can be easily filled in as the text box can be expanded into a pop-up, resembling a notebook. This improved\ninterface provides a more spacious and concentrated writing experience.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/types-of-fields\nRich text impact cases\nRich text fields can be used in templates, and they support template formatting when integrated as merge fields.\u00a0\nFormatting options such as bold or italics, when applied on the merge field, affect the entire text in the Rich text field uniformly.\u00a0\nFor color application in Rich text merge fields within templates, any uncolored plain text will adopt the template's color, while text that is already colored\nremains unchanged.\u00a0\nRegarding links, applying a link to a Rich text merge field in a template will assign that link to the text. However, if the Rich text data already contains a\nlink, the template's link will only apply to the text preceding the first existing link in the field.\nNotes:\nThe field cannot be made mandatory.\nRich text is supported as a field type in multi-line fields, excluding Calls and Users modules.\nThis feature is available for users with Enterprise and Ultimate editions.\nOnly 2 rich text fields are supported in Tasks and Meetings, while 5 rich text fields are available in other supported modules.\nThe character limit for Rich text fields is 50,000 characters, and the character count includes the content entered along with the HTML tags.\u00a0\nRich text fields are not supported in subforms, List View, Kanban View, Canvas View, Sheet View, Related Lists, Lookup popup, global search,\nfilters and criteria, formula fields, report export, and integrations.\nApart from that, rich text fields would not be supported in the mobile app as well.\nRich text fields are supported when exporting records. The data will be exported as HTML content. For example, Bold will be exported as\n<b>Bold</b>.\nNote:\nIt is advised to avoid using rich text fields in templates to prevent any formatting problems as mentioned earlier.\nRich text fields aren't supported in mail merge templates, as well as for integrations.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/types-of-fields\nCurrency Fields\nThe currency field allows you to define the decimal and the precision settings based on your selected currency locale. There are four rounding options available\nfor a currency field in Zoho CRM:\u00a0\nAdditional details on Rich Text Fields\nDuring import or while using APIs, users can add content for rich text fields using tags, which will be transformed into formatted data.\nWhen data is imported or entered into CRM through APIs, there are limitations on the tags and styles that can be used in rich text fields. Users are\nnot allowed to apply formatting such as changing the font size to be small or large. However, they will still have the ability to use attribute values,\nsuch as different icons for bulleted lists, that are not supported in the user interface.\nCheck the table below for the complete list of allowed tags and the attributes allowed for the tags respectively.\nAllowed tags\nAllowed attributes\nb\u00a0\u2014 Bold\n\u2014\ni \u2014 Italic\u00a0\n\u2014\nu \u2014 Underline\u00a0\n\u2014\na \u2014 Link\u00a0\nhref, target, style\nsub \u2014 Subscript\nstyle\nsup \u2014 Superscript\nstyle\nul \u2014 Unordered list\nstyle\nol \u2014 Ordered list\u00a0\nstyle\nli \u2014 List\nstyle\nspan\nstyle\ndiv\u00a0\nstyle\np \u2014 Paragraph\nstyle\nsmall \u2014 Small\u00a0\n\u2014\nbr \u2014 Line break\n\u2014\ndel \u2014 strikethrough\n\u2014\nFollowing are the permissible style values:\nfont-style\nfont-weight\ntext-decoration\ncolor\nbackground-color\nlist-style-type\npadding-inline-start\nmargin-inline-start\npadding-left\nlist-style-position\ndisplay\n\u2014\nAnd, there when importing or sending data through APIs, certain reserved characters need to be changed to the equivalent form so that the system\ngets the data properly.\nIf an open tag like '<' is closed correctly, the formatting will be applied without any issues. However, if it is not closed properly, the system\nwill remove it and it will not be recognized as a 'lesser than' symbol when importing.\nIf the user wants to indicate a value such as 65 < 75 in the rich text field, they should replace the symbol '<' with '&lt ;', which represents\nthis reserved character.\nThere will not be a space between &lt and semicolon. If I remove the space, it is getting converted to < in cliq. Therefore, when conveying\nthis, please remove the space.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/types-of-fields\nTo create currency type custom fields\n1.

If you wish to make this a required field, select the\u00a0 Required \u00a0check box.\n8. Click\u00a0 Done .\nLookup Fields\nLookup fields\u00a0establish connections between different modules (Leads, Contacts, Accounts, etc.) by enabling you to associate records from one module to\nanother.\n\u00a0\nFor example, let's say some of your contacts refer more leads to your business than others,\u00a0and you want to\u00a0quickly see who referred a certain lead. You can\nachieve this easily by adding a lookup field called \"Referred By\" in the Leads module that will display a list of\u00a0contacts. Whenever a new lead is added, the\ncontact who referred it can be selected and associated using the lookup field.\u00a0Also, a related list of leads will be created in the Contacts module\u2014\"Referred\nLeads,\" for example, which will display all the leads a contact has referred so far.\nTo create lookup field\n1. Log in to your Zoho CRM account with Administrative privileges.\n2. Go to\u00a0 Setup > Customization > Modules and Fields .\nModule refers to the\u00a0 Leads ,\u00a0 Accounts ,\u00a0 Contacts , etc. tabs.\n3. Select the module and the layout to which you want to add the lookup field (for example,\u00a0Leads module, standard layout).\n4. In the Layout editor, drag and drop the Lookup field from the New Fields tray.\n5. In the\u00a0 Lookup Properties\u00a0 popup, do the following:\nField label - Set the\u00a0field label to\u00a0 Referred By .\nNote\nWhen you delete a pick list value, records that have the field value associated to it will not be deleted.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/types-of-fields\nLookup Module -\u00a0 Select a lookup module from the dropdown\u2014for example, the\u00a0Contacts module.\nRelated List Title - Name it Referred Leads .\n6. Click\u00a0 Done .\n7. Click\u00a0 Save Layout.\nYou'll find the\u00a0Referred By lookup field while creating leads.\nThe Referred Leads \u00a0 related list can be found\u00a0on all contact details pages of the Contacts module, as shown below.\nUsing a lookup field\nTo associate records using the lookup field you created, you can either type the record name you intend to associate or click the icon on the right for the search\npop-up. The pop-up allows you to find records in the lookup field using values from different fields. You can add or remove the fields shown in the pop-up using\nthe Add Column option, provide desired values for fields, and use the\u00a0 Show Filter option to narrow down the search results based on your requirements.\nFor example, if you 're searching for a particular contact in a lookup field in order to associate it with a record, you can choose fields like contact name, email\naddress, phone number, country, and so on.\nTo add or remove fields from the lookup search\n1. Go to the appropriate module and select the lookup field.\nNotes:\nA maximum of five lookup fields can be added for\u00a0any criteria.\u00a0For example, while specifying criteria in workflow rules or\u00a0blueprints, or creating\ncustom views, you can use up to five lookup fields.\nLookup fields cannot be added\u00a0to the\u00a0 Tasks , Meetings , and Calls modules.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/types-of-fields\n2.

Enter the values and click Appl y Filter .\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/types-of-fields\nMulti-Select Lookup Fields\nThe Multi-Select Lookup Field enables you to establish what we call a\u00a0 many-to-many relationship \u00a0between two modules in CRM.\nFor instance, consider the example an insurance company.\nA single policy may be held by many policy holders.\nSimilarly, a single policy holder may hold many policies.\nIf you have two modules -\u00a0 Insurance Policies \u00a0and\u00a0 PolicyHolders \u00a0- there is a need to associate multiple records from each module to each other. This is not\npossible with a regular look-up field, as it allows only a one-to-many relationship.\nIn this case, you can use a Multi-select lookup field from the\u00a0 New Fields \u00a0tray in the Layout Editor. This will let you associate multiple records from two\nmodules to each other, thus establishing a many-to-many relationship in CRM.\nTo learn more about many-to-many relationship and creating a multi-select lookup field,\u00a0 click here .\nSelf-referencing Multi-select Lookup Field\nYou can create an association between the records from the same module. For example, in an employee database you can use a multi-select lookup field to\nassociate other employees as managers or subordinates.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn the image below, you can see that Peter, Alice, and Kathy are employees. However, their association with Kathy as Manager and Subordinate can be viewed\nin the related list.\u00a0\u00a0\nNotes:\nYou can add up\u00a0to 10 fields in the search window.\nA common search will search only in the record name column and not in all fields.\nThis field is available for Enterprise and above editions.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/types-of-fields\nAuto Number Field\nThe auto number type custom field helps classifying the records by unique numbers and dates. Once the auto number field is added to the CRM module, the\nnumber is added sequentially to the new records. This can be used to update the existing records also. For instance, Invoice Number, Quote Number and Sales\nOrder. You can enter # or { and select a date pattern, so that the date and the auto number value both will be present in the record for example,\u00a0if you choose\n{DD}{MM} - Autonumber, the value will be populated like this: product name-date-month-product code.\nTo create auto number fields\n1. Log in to your Zoho CRM account with Administrative privileges.\n2. Go to\u00a0 Setup > Customization > Modules and Fields .\nModule refers to the Leads, Accounts, Contacts, etc. tabs.\n3. Select the module from the Modules list view.\nThe Layout Editor appears.\n4. Drag and drop the\u00a0 Auto Number field type \u00a0from the\u00a0 New Fields \u00a0tray.\n5. In the\u00a0 Auto Number Properties\u00a0 popup, do the following:\nEnter a name in the\u00a0 FieldLabel\u00a0 field.\nUnder the\u00a0 Auto Number Format\u00a0 section, enter the\u00a0 Prefix, Starting Number\u00a0 & the\u00a0 Suffix\u00a0 for the auto number value.\nYou can check the preview.\n6. Click\u00a0 Done.\n7. Click\u00a0 Save Layout.\nUser Field\nNote\nYou can add only two multi-select lookup fields to a module. Out of the two one can be a self-referencing field.\nOnce a record is associated, you will not be able to view it when you click the assign button. Records already associated will not be displayed\nagain.\nSimilarly, once a record is associated it cannot be associated with another related list item. For example, if Peter is associated as manager he\ncannot be associated as subordinate.\u00a0\nNote\u00a0\nWhile creating a record an auto-number may get skipped due to exceptions like time-out or transaction error.\u00a0\nHowever, this will not lead to any loss of data.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/types-of-fields\nBy\u00a0default all records in\u00a0CRM\u00a0have a\u00a0record owner\u00a0who is entitled to perform and oversee\u00a0all the activities that happen within a record.\u00a0 For example, update of\na field, addition of new information, edit of a field, etc. \u00a0This user is called the primary record owner .\u00a0However,\u00a0there can be\u00a0instances where\u00a0one or more\nusers may come into the picture.\u00a0 For example, you can collaborate with your peers to close a high-value deal, or you can involve your SME to provide\ntechnical expertise on something particular . Likewise, there may be multiple instances when the involvement of peers or other team members\u00a0to a\nrecord\u00a0becomes inevitable.\u00a0\nIn such cases, you can use the user field to provide multiple-ownership to a record.\u00a0As\u00a0co-owners, these\u00a0users will be able to update, modify, add or delete\ndetails on the record as and when required, or just view records based on their permissions.\nAvailability\nAdding a User Field\nAdding a user field to a record layout is done by simply dragging and dropping the field\u00a0to the layout editor.\u00a0 Zoho CRM provides two types of user fields, you\ncan choose either of them based on your requirement.\nSingle User - You can add up to 5 single user fields in a module.\nMultiple Users - You can add only 1 multi-user field in a module that can include up to 10\u00a0users.\nTo configure user field\n1.

However, if you prefer not to share the record and the ownership, their privilege to access the records can be revoked.\nThis can be achieved by\u00a0unchecking the\u00a0allow\u00a0record\u00a0accessibility option in the User field. This option will let you decide whether\u00a0the user can access the\nrecord or not.\u00a0\nTo revoke the accessibility of a record\n1. Go to Setup > Customization > Modules and Fields.\n2. In the Modules tab, select the corresponding module.\n3. In the Layouts page, select the corresponding layout.\n4. In the layout builder, click on the ellipses icon (...)\u00a0 near the user field and select Edit Properties.\n5. In the User Field Properties page, uncheck the Allow Record Accessibility option.\nActions in Records Based on Profile Permission\nEach member of an organization has a different role, based on which their profile permission is defined within the Zoho CRM account. For instance, a Sales\nmanager can have an administrative profile but a sales executive can have a standard profile. Depending on the profile a co-owner will be able to perform the\nactions in a record. See also (Profile permissions).\nNote\nYou can configure\u00a0User Field\u00a0for all the modules except for Tasks, Calls, and Meetings ( Activities ) modules.\nIf you remove the\u00a0User Field\u00a0from a particular layout, the co-owners will not be able to view the record unless the field is added again to the\nlayout.\nNotes :\nYou can add up to\u00a0 5 single user fields and\u00a0 1 multiple user field\u00a0in a module.\u00a0\nIn\u00a0one\u00a0multi-user field, you can add up to\u00a0 10 users.\nRecord accessibility option applies to both Single and Multiple User fields.\nThe Record accessibility\u00a0option\u00a0will be checked by default in the user field properties.\u00a0To revoke\u00a0the record accessibility privilege,\u00a0the admin\nmust\u00a0uncheck the option.\nAlthough a user is allowed to access the record, the actions that can be performed as a co-owner depend upon the profile the associated user is\nassigned to.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/types-of-fields\nFor example, Emily Ross is a Sales Manager at Zylker Inc. and has administrative privilege in the CRM account. Hence, she can\u00a0Edit\u00a0or Close task\u00a0in a\nrecord\u00a0that she co-owns.\nView related list of a Record Based on Role Hierarchy\nThe co-owner of a record will be able to view the related list of the record based on their role\u00a0within the organization.\u00a0\nFor example, Emily Ross is the Sales Manager in Zylker Inc., she can view the related activities of her subordinate co-owner (Sales Executive /Tim Drummond)\nright within her CRM account.\nTo view associated records\n1.

Instead of running a report separately\nfor that particular account,\u00a0they can use a rollup field to compute this; and the best part is that this field will be added to the layout and all records in the layout\nwill carry the same field, each with their respective values computed.\nConfiguring a rollup field\nRollup summaries, like other field types, are available in the new fields tray of a module's layout. In order for a rollup field to aggregate values, a property has to\nbe assigned to the field from the list of pre-defined properties available for that module.\nPermission required\nOnly administrators or users with customization permissions can access this field. The rollup field in the record, however, is displayed for all users.\n\u00a0\nEdition-based limits\nRollup fields\u00a0are available for organizations using\u00a0Enterprise and Ultimate editions only.\nEnterprise: 10 rollup fields per module\nUltimate: 15 rollup fields per module\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/types-of-fields\nTotal number of tasks, deals won revenue, total untouched deals, total completed tasks, and so on are among\u00a0the options available for the related lists in the\nselected module.\nIn the image below, you can see that for the Contacts module, the properties from its related lists\u2014deals, notes, attachments, meetings, sales orders, invoices,\nand so on\u2014are listed for rollup.\nData types considered for rollup\nA rollup summary field type can aggregate the following types of data:\nCount of related list records\nAggregation of numerical data,\u00a0such as:\nNumber\nCurrency\nDecimal\nPercentage\nLong integer\nSummarizes date field types, such as:\nDate\nDate/time\nNotes:\nRollup summary fields\u00a0are\u00a0read-only fields that display in a record after saving.\nYou can add rollup fields for both standard and custom module layouts.\nRollup field is available in all modules except tasks, calls, meetings, and appointments.\nOnly those system-defined related lists available and applicable for the parent module are displayed.\nCRM only considers the emails and notes belonging to the parent record. Emails or notes that are brought in from other modules\u2014although\ndisplayed in the related list\u2014will not be included in the computation.\nIf you have multi-currency enabled, the rollup is calculated based on your organization's base currency,\u00a0but then displays the correct value with\nrespect to the record's custom\u00a0currency.\nFor now, only those emails sent via Zoho CRM's built-in feature are considered for rollup.\nFor organizations with integrated email servers, Zoho CRM considers only the upcoming emails;\u00a0past information will not be aggregated.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/types-of-fields\nTo add a rollup summary field\n1. Go to Setup > Customization > Modules and Fields and select a module.\n2. Select a layout and then drag and drop the Rollup summary field from the New Fields tray.\n3. On the Rollup Summary Properties page, click on your desired related list item and choose a property for the field.\nYou can also search for a desired property from the search bar located\u00a0towards the right side of the properties' page.\n4. Upon ascribing a property to the field, click Save.\nRollup summary fields in Workflow rules\nNote: Like all other fields, you can set field permissions and remove the field from the layout.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/types-of-fields\nSee also:\u00a0\u00a0\nFAQs: Field Customization\n\u00a0Users can configure workflow rules to be triggered by updates within a Rollup summary field, allowing for separate configuration.\nRollup summary fields will be available as criteria options for configuring the conditions of the rule.\nLet's say you have a rollup summary (like the Total Deal Count in the Accounts module) that updates when there's a change in a related list item\n(for example, a deal record is updated). If there's a workflow set up on this rollup summary that affects the related list of accounts (such as adding\na deal record), this action will update the rollup summary. Consequently, the workflow for this rollup summary is triggered again, causing the\nprocess to repeat once more.\n", "source": "types-of-fields.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "data-administration-overview", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/overview/articles/data-administration-overview\nZoho Corporation\nData Administration - An Overview\nThe purpose of the Zoho CRM data administration tools are to guide the CRM Administrator in creating,\nverifying and ensuring data integrity by maintaining relationships and implementing access controls throughout\nthe databases.\nBased on the organization's requirement, user(s) with Administrator privilege can set up the CRM data\nadministration.

Instead of using a mouse to navigate menus and click\non options, keyboard shortcuts provide a faster alternative by utilizing various keys or key combinations.\nWhy we need Keyboard Shortcuts\u00a0\nSome of the tasks we perform in Zoho CRM can be done more quickly and efficiently if we use keyboard\nshortcuts. These shortcuts can save a substantial amount of time while multitasking. They also allow you to switch\nbetween tabs, screens windows, and modules in a faster than mouse navigation.\u00a0\nKeyboard Shortcuts in Zoho CRM\u00a0\nZoho CRM has several built-in keyboard shortcuts, such as focusing or moving the cursor to the next field while\nentering data in forms. Additionally, Zoho CRM also provides configurable keyboard shortcuts. These keyboard\nshortcuts are categorized into three types:\nGeneral\nRecord Pages\nRecord's Create Page/Edit/Clone Page\nRecords View\nRecord Details View\nSwitch Tabs\nKeyboard shortcuts can be configured for the above-mentioned attributes. Zoho CRM has multiple default\nshortcuts provided for these features, which can be customized later based on your requirements. Frequently-\naccessed actions are included for shortcuts. The below table shows the actions that have keyboard shortcuts.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/organization-settings/personal-settings/articles/keyboard-shortcuts-in-zoho-crm\nAccessing Keyboard Shortcuts\nTo access keyboard shortcuts, navigate to Setup\u00a0 > General > Personal Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts.\u00a0\nKeyboard shortcuts are disabled by default for all accounts. Users have to enable them manually.\u00a0\nBuiltThe built-in shortcuts are displayed on the landing page, such as record searching, field focus shortcut keys,\nand so on. These shortcuts cannot be modified, as they are built in.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/organization-settings/personal-settings/articles/keyboard-shortcuts-in-zoho-crm\nOnce shortcut keys are enabled, the categorized shortcut keys are displayed in different sections. They can be used\nas they are defined, or they can be modified accordingly.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/organization-settings/personal-settings/articles/keyboard-shortcuts-in-zoho-crm\nConfiguring Keyboard Shortcuts\nWhen you hover on the list of shortcuts, the edit icon will display. Click on this to modify the shortcut key.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/organization-settings/personal-settings/articles/keyboard-shortcuts-in-zoho-crm\nA shortcut can contain a minimum of one key to a maximum of three keys. The keys are not case-sensitive. If you\ndo not want a shortcut key for certain action, you can just leave the field empty. There are certain limitations for\nusing certain keys, which are mentioned below.\u00a0\nThe above combination of keys has been identified to create conflicts inside Zoho CRM, so it is better to avoid\nthe above-mentioned keys while configuring shortcut keys.\u00a0\nTo get a clear detail about keyboard shortcuts, let's look at a few examples.\u00a0\nTo coincide with the shortcut for CRM Plus, we changed the default shortcut for record search from\n\"alt\"+\"space\" to \"/\".\nSystem shortcuts will be prioritized over any CRM shortcuts provided in this document.\nFor instance, this would apply if a specific CRM operation required the CMD+SPACE key combination.\nWhen using this shortcut, we only launch spotlight, because the system shortcuts take precedence.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/organization-settings/personal-settings/articles/keyboard-shortcuts-in-zoho-crm\nScenario 1\nZylker Real Estates is a organization that has two layouts in their account. One layout handles customer details\nfrom the southern region and another layout handles customer details from the northern region. You are a user in\nZylker, and you constantly have to shift between layouts while operation in CRM. Switching from one layout to\nanother layout by navigating through the mouse seems a bit tedious. What if there were a simpler way to switch\nbetween layouts?\u00a0\nYes, you can use the keyboard shortcuts to switch between layouts. Using keyboard shortcuts can save a lot of\nyour time, and it also eases the process.\nSolution: To create a shortcut for switching layouts, navigate to Setup > General > Personal Settings >\nKeyboard Shortcuts > Record's Create Page/Edit/Clone Page > Switch Layout.\u00a0\nCreate the shortcut that you need for switching layouts, By default, the shortcut is Ctrl + l.

Email addresses of people are good\nexamples of unique fields because clearly, two people cannot have the same Email address. It is a very unique\nattribute. Other examples include Social Security Numbers, Passport Numbers, Product codes and the like. In\nZoho CRM, you can mark a field from any module as \"Unique\".

Following are exceptions to this condition, as\nthey can have 3 unique fields.\nLeads/Contacts/Custom modules (Email address + 2 fields)\nProducts module (Product Code + 2 fields).\nOnly Text, Email, Phone, Integer, Long Integer, URL fields can be marked as unique across all\nmodules. The\u00a0Twitterfield can be marked as unique for the Leads/Contacts module.\nThe unique fields are NOT case sensitive. That is, if the incoming unique field's value is \"ABC\"\nand in the existing record, it is \"abc\", Zoho CRM will still identify this as a match.\nOnce a field has been marked as unique, it may take a little while for Zoho CRM to index this\nchange in the database. That is, after marking a field as unique, if you immediately create a record\nin the module with the same value, Zoho CRM may not recognize the unique field value. It may\nallow the duplicate to be created, because the change has still not been indexed. In such a case\nplease try after a few minutes.\nTask, Calls and Meetings (Activities) modules cannot have a unique field.\nIn Zoho CRM, unique fields are supported for records that are created manually and via imports,\nAPIs and leads/quotes/sales orders conversion.\nUnique fields are not supported for records that are created via CRM migration, MS Outlook and\nGoogle synchronization, restoration from the Recycle Bin.\nUnique fields are not supported for records in the Zoho Sheet View.\nWhen you mark a field as unique in the Leads module,\u00a0you will see an option to enable duplication\ncheck for converted leads as well.\nConsider a scenario. You have followed up with and converted a lead called James. Now James is\nrecord in the Contacts module.\u00a0Another sales rep in your team adds the same lead (James), without\nknowing that the lead has already been followed up with. In that case, there is no need for James to\nbe added as a lead again - it will simply be a duplicate entry.\nIn this case, you can stop the creation of the same lead by enabling duplication check for converted\nleads. Once you have enabled this, whenever a duplicate entry is added in Leads, CRM will check\nexisting leads as well as converted leads for matches.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/use-custom-fields\nSet External Field\nA custom single line field can be marked as an external\nfield where information about the record from a third-party application can be stored. When you integrate an\napplication with CRM you can upsert API call to search, create or update, and delete records using the external\nID.\nFor example, if the patients IDs are stored in an external database you can use it in the external field to refer,\nupdate or delete details in CRM.\nSimilarly you can use other fields that refer to the patient's records as well.\nThere are two types of external fields:\nUser based: A different external ID will be generated for each user. For example, if a contact is managed by\ntwo different users in the org, each one will have his own external ID for the same contact.\u00a0\u00a0\nOrganization based: All the users in the org will have a common external ID.\u00a0\u00a0\nTo set a field external or to create an external ID\n1.

When you remove a custom field,\nit is moved to the\u00a0Unused Fieldssection. This means that it is only removed from the layout and not the CRM\nitself.\nTo delete the field permanently from the CRM, you must delete it again from the\u00a0Unused Fields\u00a0section.\nTo remove custom fields from the layout\nNote\u00a0\nWhile performing Find and Merge action, the external ID of the master record will be retained, that\nis the external ID of other duplicate records will be overwritten.\nWhen a record is cloned the external ID will not be copied to the new record. You can later update\nthe value in the field (external ID) through API.\nDuring the conversion of a record such as lead, orders, quotes etc. you will be allowed to map an\nexternal field only with another external field present in the subsequent module.\nDuring data import any field present in the .CSV file can be mapped with an external field present\nin the CRM module.

This can be defined as a parent-child\nrelationship. For example, let's say there are two fields - Country and State - in your Leads module. The values in\nthe State field will depend on the country that you select from the Country field. Similarly, the values for the Sub-\nDepartment field will depend on the Department field that you select. This kind of relationship is established by\nmapping dependency fields. You can define which values will appear in the Child field when a certain value is\nchosen in the Parent field.\nNote\nWhen a custom field is moved to the\u00a0Unused Fields\u00a0section, it is only removed from the module's\nlayout and not Zoho CRM. As long as the removed field is in the\u00a0Unused Fields\u00a0section, you can\nrestore it by dragging and dropping it back in the required section.\nRestoring a field from the\u00a0Unused Fields\u00a0section restores its associated data as well.\nWhen a removed field is in the\u00a0Unused Fields\u00a0section, it is still part of the database. Therefore the\ntotal number of fields allowed for your Zoho CRM Edition includes the fields in the\u00a0Unused\nFields\u00a0section.\nTo delete a custom field permanently from Zoho CRM, you must delete it again from the\u00a0Unused\nFields\u00a0section.\nOnce deleted from the\u00a0Unused Fields\u00a0section you cannot bring back the custom field and its\nassociated data.\nStandard fields that are provided in Zoho CRM by default can be moved to the\u00a0Unused\nFields\u00a0section but cannot be deleted permanently.\nMap Dependency is available for the picklist fields present in the Subforms too.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/use-custom-fields\nTo map field dependencies\n1.

Their cost-\neffectiveness is attractive to small businesses. The ability to maintain conversations with multiple stakeholders\nacross different departments is used by mid-market firms. Enterprises use it as a formal and auditable means of\ncommunication during high-stakes negotiations.\nIn Zoho CRM, a deal can be linked to the following stakeholders:\nA primary contact who is the main person you're dealing with in order to close that deal. For example, this\ncould be the sales champion in some contexts, the decision maker in some other contexts, and so on. There\ncan only be one primary contact for a deal.\nContact roles are other stakeholders who are involved in that deal. For example, technical experts, members\nof the legal, finance, or purchasing team, and so on are usually marked as contact roles. For large deals, it is\nthe norm that multiple stakeholders in a company are involved in the process of finalizing a deal.\nSo, it is possible to link a single deal with multiple contacts. It is also true that a single contact can have multiple\ndeals associated with them (either as the primary contact or as a contact role).\nEmails are linked to contacts, but in order to follow up or close a particular deal, you would likely find it tiresome\nto go through all the emails of a contact, filter out the ones related to that deal, and repeat the same for all\nstakeholders. Instead, you may prefer to see the emails distinctly marked to a deal, rather than having all the\nemails of a contact listed together.\nIn Zoho CRM, you can associate each email with a deal to conveniently follow conversations related to that\nparticular deal. This linking can be done either:\nAutomatically based on a predefined prediction pattern\nManually from within the Deals or Contacts modules.\nThe following table shows the actions that are supported for primary contacts and contact roles when it comes to\nassociating their emails with a deal.\nAction\nPrimary contact\nContact role\nView emails in a related deal's record\nYes\nYes\nViewing contact roles' emails within a deal's record and linking them with deals is available for all users\nin all DCs, for organizations whose users have have all switched to the latest email configuration.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-configuration/articles/email-association-with-deal\nAutomatic linking of an email to a deal\nYes\nNo\nManual linking of an email to a deal\nYes\nYes\nReplacing or changing the linked deal of an\nemail\nYes\nYes\nUn-linking a deal from an email\nYes\nYes\nAvailability\nEmail Views From the Deals Module\nThe email communication for a deal is listed in the Email Related lists of the deal and the associated contact. In\nthe Deals module, there are two options to view the associated emails:\nEmails associated with this deal\u00a0- This is a default option that will display only those emails that are\nrelated to the particular deal.\nEmails associated with the related contact - This option will display all the emails that are related to the\nassociated contact or contact roles.\nTo select an email view\n1.

Go to the Emails Related List, then choose one of the following from the drop-down list:\nEmails associated with this deal.\nEmails associated with the related contact.\nNote\nEmails from contact roles will be available under \"Emails associated with related contacts\".\nPermission Required\nUsers\u00a0who have configured IMAP integration can access this feature.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-configuration/articles/email-association-with-deal\nAuto-link Emails by Deal Prediction Mechanism\nZoho CRM automatically links a contact's incoming emails to the deals using the Deal Prediction Method. This\nlinking of emails only happens with deals where the contact is the primary contact. Emails will not be linked\nautomatically to deals where the contact is involved in a contact role.\nWhen you receive an email:\nIf the contact has only one deal in Zoho CRM\nIf the deal is open/ Closed Won, then the email will be linked to that deal.\nIf the deal is Closed Lost, the email will not be linked to that deal and will be retained under the\ncontact's emails related list.\nIf the contact has multiple deals in CRM\nIf the last modified deal is open/ Closed Won, the email will be linked to that deal.\nIf the last modified deal is Closed-Lost and there are no open deals, the email will not be linked to\nany deal and will be retained under the contact's emails related list.\nIf the last modified deal is Closed-Lost and there are open deals, the email will be linked to the last\nmodified open deal.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-configuration/articles/email-association-with-deal\nNote\nDuring a fresh IMAP configuration, the previous emails will be linked to the deal only if the\ncontact had a single deal associated to it at the time of receipt of the email.\nIf the contact had more than one open deal the email will not be linked and will be listed under the\ncontact's Email related list and the user can manually link it to the deal. In the Deals module. these\nemails will be displayed under \"Emails associated with the Contact\".\nOnce an email is linked to a deal, within the Deals and the Contacts modules, these emails will\ndisplay the \"linked\" icon.

Example 2:\u00a0In the\u00a0vehicle\u00a0module, there is a field named\u00a0insurance. When the same name has been used to\ncreate a field in the\u00a0vehicle\u00a0module inside the sandbox, a\u00a0conflict\u00a0occurs due to the\u00a0name overriding.\niii. Example 3:\u00a0Sandbox has edition-wise limitations. Let's say, you can create only three layouts per module,\nand already three layouts created in your production account. Now if you are trying to deploy another\nlayout for the same module, then it will show a conflict message as the feature limit is getting exceeded.\niv. Example 4: There can be situations where a developer has configured changes in your sandbox and that\nleads to a conflict during deployment. With the latest enhancement, you will now have the option to resolve\nit directly on the deployment pop-up.\u00a0\nIn Example 2 and Example 4, you have the option to rename the field in the vehicle module and remove the\ndeveloper from the list of available users in the org directly from the deployment pop-up. However, for the other\nexamples, conflicts must be resolved manually before continuing with deployment.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/sandbox/articles/deploy-sandbox\nYou can view the details about the qualified and conflicted deployments and confirm the deployment.\u00a0 \u00a0\nTo deploy Sandbox changes to production\n1.

The date of the deployment\n2. The name of the sandbox environment the changes were deployed from\n3. The changes that were deployed\n4. The user who deployed the changes\n7. Updating a field in the sandbox and deploying the changes to production will overwrite the existing\nfield properties. For example, if the email field is marked as \"mandatory\" in the sandbox and as a \"unique\nfield\" in production. Then, after deployment, the field property will be overwritten to mandatory.\u00a0\n8. To know whether you are working on the Sandbox environment or production setup, look out for a\nbright orange Sandbox ribbon. This is used to differentiate Sandbox from your production setup.\u00a0\n9. Sandbox is used to test and validate configurations before they are moved onto the production account,\ntherefore, records populated, imported or manually added to the Sandbox account cannot be deployed to\nproduction.\u00a0\n10.

The\nfour important factors in stage probability mapping are: Deal stages, Probability, Deal Category, and Forecast\nCategory.\n1. Deal stages:\u00a0A few system defined deal stages such as qualification, needs analysis, negotiation, closed\nwon, closed lost etc. that are used to define a typical sales process. You can also create custom stages\naccording to your business process.\n2. Probability:\u00a0Associate probability values to each stage to determine the likelihood of closing a deal\nsuccessfully. It will also be used to calculate the Expected Revenue of the deal based on the deal amount.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/modify-special-fields\n3. Deal category:\u00a0Associate a category to every stage to define the overall state of\u00a0\u00a0a deal. There are three\ncategories: open, closed won, closed lost for every stage to define the overall state of a deal.\nOpen - Represents that the deal is still in the sales cycle.\nClosed won - This defines that the deal is won and is out of the sales cycle.\nClosed lost - At this state the deal is lost and is thus not present in the sales cycle anymore.\u00a0\n4. Forecast category:\u00a0Forecast category helps in calculating the forecast target of individuals or organization\nbased on the deal stage in the sales cycle. For example, if your sales forecast is about the total revenue\ngenerated from the closed deals, then only the closed won deals will be taken into consideration. There are\nthree forecast categories: Pipeline, closed and omitted.\u00a0\nPipeline - Indicates the deal is still in pipeline and is yet to be finalized. These deals will be counted\nwhen a forecast is drawn for open deals.\nClosed - Indicates the deal is won and will be taken into account for forecast on closed deals.\nOmitted - Indicates the deal is lost and thus won't be considered for forecast calculation.\u00a0\nMapping forecast and deal category\nThe forecast category is automatically mapped with the deal category to facilitate accurate estimations.\u00a0\nThe deal categories: Open, closed won, closed lost are mapped with the following forecast category: pipeline,\nclosed and omitted respectively.\nTo map stage and probability values\n1. Log in to Zoho CRM with Administrator privileges.\n2. Go to\u00a0Setup > Customization > Modules and Fields\nNote\nFor a better sales pipeline analysis assign different probabilities to sales stage values.\nFor each stage assign probability in the range of 0 to 100.\nYou may consider using probability value as 100 when the deal is closed-won and 0 for deal\nclosed-lost.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/modify-special-fields\n3.

Contact Roles\nhelp in knowing the role of the contact in the prospective organization so you always have the right discussion\nwith the right person. For instance, explaining details about the product price and discounts is always better with\nthe Financial Manager whereas explaining product features should be discussed with the Product Manager.\nSome of the contact roles such as, Decision Maker, Product Management, Purchasing and other roles are\navailable.

Click\u00a0Save\u00a0after associating roles to all the contacts.\nAdd\u00a0Reporting Manager for Contacts\nManaging any sales deal involves several rounds of discussions and multiple meetings with contacts. However,\nthere can be instances when the primary contact person is either unavailable or unable to attend the meetings.\nSuch unforeseen scenarios may sometimes lead to incessant delays in the sales processes. To avoid such\nsituations, you can mention a reporting manager for the primary contact who can act as an alternate point of\ncontact in the former's absence.\nIn Zoho CRM's\u00a0Contacts\u00a0module, you can assign\u00a0a reporting manager to a contact using the \"Reporting to\" field.\nThis field is a lookup field and you can view only the contacts that are associated to an account.\nHowever, there are\u00a0instances when the contact's will not be displayed in the\u00a0Reporting to\u00a0field, below are 2\nexamples highlighting the same:\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/modify-special-fields\nIf the account name\u00a0is changed then the contact's associated to that account will not be displayed anymore.\nFor example, if account name ABC Corp is changed to Zylker Inc., then the contacts associated to ABC Corp\nwill be removed from the reporting to field.\u00a0\nIf the contact is transferred to another account\u00a0the contact's name will be removed from the reporting to field.\nFor example, if Matha Willis is moved from ABC Corp to Zylker Inc. her name will\u00a0be removed from the\ncontacts related to ABC Corp account.\u00a0\nView Contact Hierarchy\nYou can view the direct reports of a contact and the overall reporting structure right within the related lists of a\nrecord in both\u00a0Accounts\u00a0and\u00a0Contacts\u00a0modules.\nIn Contacts module\u00a0- A related list named \"Reporting Contacts\" is created that displays the direct reports and\nthe reporting hierarchy structure of the contacts.\nNote\nThe reporting to field will not be displayed under map fields during import.\nIn case\u00a0the account name is edited or changed either manually or through API,\u00a0the reporting to field\nwill not display the set contact name\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/modify-special-fields\nIn Accounts module\u00a0- You can view the contacts hierarchy from the \"Contacts\" related list.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/modify-special-fields\n", "source": "modify-special-fields.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "view-activities", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/managing-module-views/articles/view-activities\nZoho Corporation\nUsing CRM View for Activities\nFor any sales person, a typical day at work is loaded with tasks.

You can create a mail merge template which contains variables (merge\nfields), which will merge data from Zoho CRM and create\u00a0 merged documents with the correct information for the\nvariables.\nFor example, suppose you have to send personalized letters to a large number of leads or create templates for\nservice level agreements or other legal documents. In these cases, you do not need to manually type the details of\neach lead in the letters to personalize them. Instead, you can simply create a template using merge fields from the\nLeads module and then when you merge the data, the letters will be personalized for each person.\nThere are two ways you can create a mail merge template:\n1. Create a template from\u00a0 scratch.\n2.

Go to Setup >\u00a0Modules and Fields > Services.\n2. Make sure the Job Sheet Preference under Preferences is active.\nHandling different currencies\nIf the currency in your file isn't the same as the CRM's home currency, the CRM will use its default\ncurrency. For instance, an amount like\u00a0\u20b95000 INR in your import file will be converted to $5000\nUSD in your CRM if the home currency is USD.\nBusiness hours and service availability\nIf a service is available only for a portion of your designated business hours, its service hours will\nbe adjusted accordingly. Conversely, if the service falls entirely outside your business hours, it will\nbe designated as \"Not in Use,\" and will trigger a warning notification.\nFor instance, consider a service with custom hours from 2 PM to 4 PM, with a duration of one hour.\nIf the organization's business hours are from 9 AM to 3 PM, the service timing will be adjusted to 2\nPM to 3 PM and updated in the account.\nIn a scenario where the service has a duration of two hours, the adjustment of service timing will\nrender the duration incompatible; hence, the service status will be updated to \"Not in Use\".\nAgain, assume a service is available on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. If the business hours cover\nonly Monday and Tuesday, Sunday will be excluded from the service availability, and the service\nwill be updated accordingly. However, if the business hours are on Wednesday, the service will be\nmarked as \"Not in Use\". Any transition of service status from \"Available\" or \"Temporarily\nUnavailable\" to \"Not in Use\" will generate a warning on the history page.\nDealing with unconfirmed users\nServices that are associated with unconfirmed users will not be transferred during the migration\nprocess and will be skipped. It's important to make sure that all users in the CRM are confirmed\nbefore initiating the migration. Additionally, inactive and confirmed users can still be part of the\nservices.\nAppointments\nAbout appointment owners\nAppointment owners do not need to be among the members providing the service, but they must be\nconfirmed users in the CRM.\nAddressing engagement constraints\nThe CRM system permits the migration of appointments for Appointment Owners even if they have\nother commitments. For example, if the appointment owner already has another appointment\nh d l d t th\nti\nth\nt\nill till dd th\ni t\nt\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/data-migration/articles/migrating-between-zoho-crm-accounts\nMigrate data from Zoho ContactManager\nTo migrate data from Zoho ContactManager\n1.

If not, the CRM will skip those appointments during migration.\nService status and migration\nEven if appointments have a status of \"Not in Use\" under services, they can still be migrated.\nManaging business addresses in appointments\nDuring migration, the CRM will use the business address from the import file for appointments.\nFor scheduled appointments, the CRM will default to the organization's registered business address.\nMigration of appointment duration\nThe duration of the appointment will be determined based on the appointment records.

To do so, follow these steps:\n1. Click the module view button\u00a0at the top-right corner of the page.\n2. Select the desired canvas view for which you haven't yet created a view.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/managing-module-views/articles/customizing-module-view-using-the-all-new-canvas-design-suite\n3. On the following page, click Create view. This will directly take you to the Canvas builder.\nAdd data quickly: Instead of searching and dragging desired fields from the data component, you can\nsimply right click on the template, go to insert, and then click field or action.\nCreate conditional styling: You can determine the criteria and change the styling of a particular\ncomponent, such as a font size change, color change, and so on.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/managing-module-views/articles/customizing-module-view-using-the-all-new-canvas-design-suite\nMark a component fixed/fluid: If you mark a component to be fluid, the component will render the entire\nspan of the text in the output. If you mark it fixed, irrespective of the character count, the text will be\nconstricted to the defined length, sometimes clipping the tail end of the text.\nCopy/paste style: Instead of formatting a particular style repeatedly, you can copy the style and apply it to\nthe component(s) you want to format. Right-click on the style you want to copy and click copy style. Then\nselect the component you want to replicate the styling for, right-click on the component, and click paste\nstyle.\nLock a component: Locking a component will make it easier to edit the template by keeping the\ncomponent in place while you make adjustments.\nHide/show label: A label is a field's name. You can choose to display a field's name or just its values while.\nThis is a great way to maximize space in your template.\nFormat label alignment: You can choose the text alignment for text boxes, namely left, center, or right.\nMore assets on Canvas in Zoho CRM:\nHelp document: Customizing record details page using Canvas\nContextual video: Purpose and Benefits of Canvas\nHandbook: Get hands-on with Canvas\nLMS course: Canvas in Zoho CRM\nBrowse through a list of certified canvas designers available in your country here.\n", "source": "customizing-module-view-using-the-all-new-canvas-design-suite.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "social-integration-in-sandbox", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/sandbox/articles/social-integration-in-sandbox\nZoho Corporation\nSocial integration in sandbox\nSocial media platforms like Twitter and Facebook have become vital for understanding and engaging customers.\nZoho CRM allows you to monitor and engage with these platforms from within your CRM.

Other situations in which even a\nvalid email address might result in a hard bounce include:\nEmail delivery being blocked by the recipient's email server.\nThe recipient having unsubscribed from the mailing list.\nNote\nWhen emails are sent via Zoho CRM, you can attach files up to 10MB.\nWhen the emails are sent via IMAP or email relay, you can attach files up to\u00a030MB.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/user\n-functions/articles/email-communication-send-and-receive-mails\nIf, while sending an email from Zoho CRM, you receive an alert message stating Mail Address does not exist,\nit's likely a hard bounce.

The CRM system automatically synchronizes emails received\nfrom your leads, contacts, and other stakeholders from the configured mailbox and associates them with the\nrespective records under the Emails related list on the corresponding Leads, Contacts, Accounts, Deals, Vendors,\nor other module's record pages. Furthermore, emails related to the contacts associated with a deal will be\ndisplayed under the Email section on the Deals page.\nImportant Notes\nLeads, contacts, and deals with no email address will not display any emails in their Email section.\nChanges made to the email address (for leads or contacts) will only fetch emails linked to the new email\naddress. Emails linked to the previous email address will no longer be available in the CRM.\nChanging the mailbox (the email address configured for Zoho CRM) will not display emails from the\npreviously configured mailbox.\nEmails received from the secondary email address are synced in the record's emails related list.\nThe syncing of emails received from custom email addresses will depend on your custom email field\npreferences.\nAdd email attachments to related lists or WorkDrive\u00a0\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/user\n-functions/articles/email-communication-send-and-receive-mails\nEmails received from customers or colleagues often include attachments that you may wish to store within the\nCRM record for easy access. Rather than downloading or manually attaching these files, you can conveniently\nadd them to an Attachment related list or upload them to your Zoho WorkDrive.\n\u00a0\nThis approach ensures that other members of your organization, who have permission for a particular record, can\neffortlessly access these attachments whenever necessary, without the need to navigate through a lengthy email\nthread.\n\u00a0\nAny image, document, or file attached in the email can be directly included in the record's attachments within the\nAttachment related list, in your WorkDrive storage.\n\u00a0\nCustom email fields preferences\nNote:\nThe attachments will count towards your file storage limit. That is, based on the storage limit that is\nallowed for the subscribed edition you will be able to attach.\nThe system will not identify duplicate attachments at the moment.\nThe custom email fields preferences can be enabled only when all the users in an organization are\nin the latest email configuration.\nThis is currently supported for IMAP and POP3 users only.\nIf any org has active Gmail API integration, for now they cannot enable this preference and this\nwill be supported in few months.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/user\n-functions/articles/email-communication-send-and-receive-mails\nBy default, emails received from custom email field addresses will not be synced in the record's emails related\nlist.

Choose the sandbox type: There are two types of sandboxes to meet different business requirements:\nConfiguration and Configuration and Data. The table below explains the benefits of both types of sandboxes.\nSandbox Type\nUseful For\nSandbox Specification\nConfiguration\nTesting and deploying the\u00a0\u00a0CRM\nconfigurations using your own data.\n\u00a0\nUsers can test either all of the\navailable CRM configurations or\na selected specific configurations\nin the sandbox based on your\nrequirement.\nConfiguration and Data\nTesting and deploying the\u00a0\u00a0CRM\nconfigurations inside sandbox, along\nwith populated CRM records data. This\nsaves time, and also lets you test with\nreal time data.\u00a0\nUsers can either choose to\npopulate sample data or\nproduction data along with the\nconfigurations to test in the\nsandbox.\u00a0 While deploying the\nchanges to production, only the\nconfigurations will be copied,\nany records created in sandbox\nwill not be copied.\n2. Select the configurations:\u00a0 You can select the configurations to test, from the Items availability in Sandbox .\nFor example, to test user related configurations, you can check the required features\u00a0 under Users and Control.\nOnly the selected configurations will appear in the created sandbox.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/sandbox/articles/creating-sandbox\n3. Select the data population type:\u00a0 The sandbox account can be tested with pre-populated sample data or data\nfrom the CRM account. However, any changes made to data in the sandbox account cannot be deployed to\nproduction.\u00a0\n(i) Sample Data Population : If you want to save the time spent on manually creating records or importing them\nto the sandbox account or don't want developers or users to view CRM records\u00a0 you can populate sample data for\ntesting. On choosing this option 10 sample records each for the Leads, Accounts, Contacts, Deals, Tasks, Calls,\nMeetings, and Notes modules will be populated. You can access records under the respective modules and make\nedits as needed. During deployment these records will not be populated on to the CRM account.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/sandbox/articles/creating-sandbox\n(ii) Partial Production Data Population\nIf you want to see the exact changes that will happen to the CRM records\u00a0 you can populate some of the\u00a0 CRM\ndata into the Sandbox environment. You can choose the number of records that should be populated in each\nmodule. You can also choose the specific modules that needs to be populated with data in the sandbox account.\u00a0\u00a0\nFor example if you choose 100 records/module, the most recently added 100 records of the chosen module will be\npopulated onto the Sandbox account.\u00a0 If the module contains a mandatory lookup field, i.e a lookup field marked\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/sandbox/articles/creating-sandbox\nas required, then the lookup module's data will also be populated in the sandbox with recent records of the\nselected record count. The association between these modules will be maintained inside the Sandbox.\nIn the above example , 500 recent records from Leads, Contacts, and Quotes modules will be\u00a0 populated to the\nSandbox account. Since, Quotes module has two mandatory lookup modules (Account and Products) and another\nnon-mandatory lookup module for Deals , automatically data from Accounts and Products modules will be\npopulated onto the Sandbox account. You cannot unselect any of the mandatory lookup modules that gets selected\nautomatically.\n4. Set accessibility of the sandbox accounts: You can add CRM users who you want to access and test the\u00a0\nconfigurations in the sandbox account. When you create multiple accounts different users can be given access to\ndifferent accounts based on what you want them to test and validate. They will be able to access only those\naccounts to which they are added.\u00a0\nOnce added, an email invitation will be sent to the users along with the sandbox URL for easy access.\nAvailability\nNumber of Sandbox accounts of different types that can be created depends on the subscribed CRM\nedition:\n\u00a0\nCRM Edition\nSandbox Type\nConfiguration\nConfiguration and Data\nEnterprise\n3\n2\nUltimate\n7\n3\nEnterprise/Ultimate Trial Edition\n2\n\u2014\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/sandbox/articles/creating-sandbox\nCreating a sandbox\nTo create a Sandbox\n1.

There could be outdated workflows,\ntemplates that fail to call the respective merge fields, and reports that are no longer valid.\nAlso, in the case of multiple CRM administrators, there could be scenarios where Administrator A has configured\nsettings for ad-hoc needs and these get abandoned when they leave. In such cases, it's all the more important to\nperiodically take stock of which of these CRM settings are still useful and which are no longer necessary. If you\ndo not clear out these junk configurations, you may end up with the following inconveniences.\na system that no longer works as expected\nrunning out of limits for each configuration (for example, workflows, templates, fields).\nbreaks in your teams' functions\nIt is therefore essential to weed out unused/outdated configurations in your CRM system, and here's where Admin\ntools enter the picture. Admin Tools offers you a better interface to view a master list of configurations and delete\nthe ones you don't need anymore.\u00a0\nHow Admin Tools Works\nAdmin tools currently let you delete\u00a0templates, custom views, workflow rules, reports, roles, profiles and webforms\nin Zoho CRM.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/admin-tools/articles/working-with-admin-tools\nOnce you access Admin Tools, you will see a master list of all available configurations in the selected feature and\nmodule.\u00a0\nFor instance, here is a master list of all custom views in the Leads module.\nYou may delete the unused custom views in two ways.\u00a0\nSelecting configurations\u00a0manually\u00a0\nThis is ideal when you know exactly which configurations you want to delete. For instance, you created a\ncouple of custom views with the wrong criteria by mistake. In this case, instead of manually deleting each\nview from the Custom Views section, you can access Admin Tools and delete these specific views by\nselecting the entries and deleting them.\u00a0\nFiltering configurations using criteria\nThis is ideal when you wish to delete a set of configurations that meet certain criteria but are not exactly\nsure of the names of the settings or the number. For example, you want to delete all configurations created\non a specific date, or by a person. Then you may use criteria to filter these configurations and delete the\nsettings in bulk.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/admin-tools/articles/working-with-admin-tools\nSelecting Configurations Manually\u00a0\n1. Go to Setup > Data Administration > Admin Tools.\u00a0\n2. Click Get Started.\u00a0\n3. Select the feature in which you would like to view and delete configurations and the applicable module. For\nexample, Custom Views in the Leads module.\u00a0\n4. Select the ones you don't need anymore and click Delete Custom Views to delete them permanently\u00a0\nFiltering Configurations Using Criteria\u00a0\n1. In the Admin Tools page, once you have selected the feature and module, click\u00a0Add Criteria.\u00a0\n2. Enter the suitable criteria and values.\u00a0For instance, if you want to filter out Custom Views that were last\naccessed a year ago.\nThen you can use the Last Accessed date as part of the criteria and get this done. All you need to do is\nchoose \"Last Accessed date is before a certain date value.\"\n3. Click Show Result. This action will fetch the complete list of custom views that were last accessed before\n11 March 2021, as per this example.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/admin-tools/articles/working-with-admin-tools\nFor instance, in this example, you see some \"untitled\" views and some with random names. These could be\njunk settings that may have been created as part of a test run and ignored later. However, the presence of\nthese settings could be a hindrance to your processes and mess with your feature limits. Now, after you have\nfiltered these views using the \"last accessed\" criteria, you may either select all views or select the ones of\nyour choice and click\u00a0Delete Custom Views.\u00a0\nCriteria in Admin Tools \u2014 Examples and Suggestions\u00a0\nThe criteria available for you to filter configurations to delete them will vary based on your choice of feature and\nmodule.\nFor instance, the criteria available for Templates are different from those in Custom Views.\u00a0\nFollowing are the features and associated criteria you can choose from.\u00a0\nPhase 1 tools :\nTemplates\u00a0\nCustom Views\nWorkflows\nReports\nCreated By\nCreated Time\nFolder Name\nLast Modified\nLast Used\nModified By\nSubject\u00a0\nTemplate Name\nCreated By\nLast Accessed\nLast Modified\nModified By\nLast Used\nView Name\nCreated By\nCreated Time\nExecute On\nLast Executed\nLast Modified\nModified By\nRule Name\u00a0\nStatus\nCreated By\nCreated Time\nDescription\nFolder Name\nLast Accessed\nLast Modified\nModified By\nReport Name\nType\nPhase 2 tools :\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/admin-tools/articles/working-with-admin-tools\nRoles\nProfiles\nWebforms\nCreated By\nCreated Time\nDescription\nLast Modified\nModified By\nNumber of Users\nRole Name\nCreate By\nCreated Time\nDescription\nLast Modified\nModified By\nNumber of Users\nProfile Name\nCreated By\nCreated Time\nForm Name\nLast Submission\nRecord Creation\nPercentage\nStatus\nSubmission\nPercentage\nDepending on your specific need, you can choose criteria of your choice to filter the right set of configurations to\ndelete.

In\nthis structure, a user is assigned a reporting manager who is entitled to view or access the user's data. Any member\nwho is at a higher role than the user can be chosen as the reporting manager. You can also choose whether the\nnon-reporting members of your organization are managed by any superior at a higher role or by the admin and/or\nsuper admin. This structure ensures controlled access of information within the organization, in part by ensuring\nthat a user has only one reporting manager.\nWe will further discuss the reporting hierarchy structure in detail with a sample model of an organizational\nhierarchy.\nExample: John Peters, the CEO of Zylker Inc., is in the administrative role and can access the entire organization's\ndata. Under him are two Sales Managers, Amelia Burrows and Emily Ross. According to Zylker's organizational\nhierarchy, Sales Executives report to the Sales Managers, so each manager will have sales executives below her\nand will have access to their data.

Following are some examples to elaborate such scenarios.\nCase I\nA person was a reporting manager for a few users but has now been demoted to a subordinate role. For instance,\nAmelia Burrows was a Sales Manager (EMEA) and Sales Executives Mark Snap and Liz Wiseman reported to\nher. If Amelia has not performed well and has been demoted, then Mark and Liz must be assigned a new reporting\nmanager.\nCase 2\nA person was a reporting manager for a few users, but has now been promoted to a higher role. For instance,\nAmelia Burrows is a Sales Manager (EMEA) and reports to Mark Houston who is VP of Sales. If Amelia is\npromoted as VP of Sales, then her reporting manager must be changed.\nCase 3\nA person has changed roles but does not have any users reporting to them, so their role change will not affect the\nreporting structure. For instance, Allen Stack is VP of Marketing and does not have users reporting to him. If he is\npromoted or demoted, the role change will not affect the reporting structure for any subordinates. However,\ndepending upon the changes to Allen's role, he may need to be assigned a reporting manager or he may be retained\nas a non-reporting member.\nCase 4\nA person was a reporting manager and has now been transferred to another branch or department. For instance,\nEmily Ross was a Sales Manager but has now transferred to the marketing branch as a Product Manager. Since,\nsales executive Jonathan Rose used to report to Emily Ross he must now be assigned a new reporting manager\nfrom the Sales branch.\nTo change roles and reporting manager\n1.

For instance, if Amelia Burrows's\nSales Manager role is deleted, then the Sales Executives Mark Snap and Liz Wiseman must be assigned a new\nreporting manager. Secondly, Amelia Burrows must be allotted a new role and reporting manager as well.\nCase 2\nIf users are transferred to another branch in the organization, they must be assigned a reporting manager from the\nnew hierarchy branch. For example, Fiona Williams is a product executive for EMEA and is now transferred to\nthe\u00a0sales executive\u00a0role.\nTo modify a role\n1.

With this as an\nexample, you will be able to implement page layouts for your organization depending on your company\u2019s\nrequirements.\nAssume that there is a large-scale mobile phone sales and services company called Zylker Mobiles. They sell\nbrand new phones and also accommodate mobile phone service requests. The sales and service of mobile phones\nfollow a different set of processes.\nThe assessment of requirements for sales is different from that of mobile service. While a request for the\npurchase of a mobile phone may call for stock verification first, a request for mobile phone service calls for\nissue assessment.\nThe people in charge of mobile sales are different from those in charge of mobile service.\nThe follow-up processes for mobile sales are different from that of mobile service.\nThat said, there might be processes that are common to both mobile sales and service as well, such as quality\ntesting and product demo. Therefore creating different modules for mobile sales and service would be a hassle, as\nthe modules would have redundant info and processes associated. Take a look at how Zoho CRM addresses these\ndiverse requirements with page layouts.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\nManage two business divisions with one (Zoho)CRM | Page\nManage two business divisions with one (Zoho)CRM | Page\u2026\nBelow is the list of actions we are going to follow in\norder to demonstrate the use of page layouts in Zoho\nCRM for Zylker Mobiles.\nPart I \u2013 Building Page layouts\nCreate two layouts - Mobile Sales and Mobile Service in the Deals module.\nBuild the two layouts with the required fields and sections. The deal stages for Mobile Sales are going to be\ndifferent from that of Mobile Service.\nPart II - Choosing layouts on record creation\nDemonstrate the choice of layout during the creation of a record, be it via import, web-forms, APIs or the\nindividual creation of a record.\nPart III \u2013 Understanding the layout field\nUnderstand how the layout field can be used to create layout based custom views, auto-follow rules, approval\nprocess and lead assignment rules.\nPart IV \u2013 Setting up workflow rules\nSet workflow rules required for mobile sales and mobile service layouts depending on the processes followed\nat Zylker Mobiles.\nDemonstrate the execution of workflow processes as configured for the layouts.\nPART V \u2013 Creating reports and dashboards\nCreate reports and dashboards for a module based on the page layout.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\nAvailability\nCreate a new layout\nTo create a new layout\n1. Go to\u00a0 Setup > Customization > Modules and Fields .\n2. From the list of available modules, click the module for which you wish to create a new layout.\n3. In the\u00a0 Module Layout \u00a0page, click \u00a0Create New Layout.\n4. Name the layout \u2013\u00a0 Mobile Sales \u00a0and add fields and sections to the layout as required. \n5. Once all the fields have been added, click\u00a0 Save Layout.\n6. On saving the layout, you will be prompted to define the permissions for the layout. In the \u00a0Layout\nPermission \u00a0popup, enter the user profiles that will have access to the layout.\n7. Now clone this layout by clicking\u00a0 Create New Layout.\u00a0\nPermission Required\nUsers with Module Customization permission can access this feature.\nCheck Feature Availability and Limits\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\n8.

You can customize\nthe form by adding fields aside from the system-defined default fields. It is layout-specific, so you can create\ndifferent forms for each layout.\nFor example, say the Contacts module has the deals look-up and the\u00a0deals\u00a0module has two layouts: mobile\nservice and mobile sale. You can create two quick create forms with different fields in it. When you create a deal\nfor mobile service, from the contacts module (through look-up), the quick create form of that layout will be\ndisplayed.\u00a0\nSimilarly, the quick create form will show or hide fields based on the layout rules. Fields can be made mandatory\nor shown based on the value entered by the user. For example, if the layout rule for mobile service states that,\nwhenever a person chooses \"repair\" then the \"model number\" should be shown and \"warranty period\" field must\nbe made mandatory.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\n\u00a0\nTo add fields in quick create form\n1. Go to\u00a0Setup > Customization > Modules and Fields.\n2. From the list of available modules, click the module for which you wish to create a new layout.\n3. In the\u00a0Module Layout\u00a0page, click\u00a0Quick Create.\n4. Drag and drop fields as required.\n5. Click\u00a0Save.\nDetail View Tab\nNote:\u00a0Only show fields and set mandatory fields actions will be applicable for quick create form.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\nThe detail view tab has two components: Business card and Related list. You can customize the business card by\nadding upto 5 standard or custom fields. Like quick create, detail view is also layout specific so you can create\ndifferent detail view for each layout.\u00a0\nYou can drag and drop fields to the related list section, re-order or modify the columns in the list view and create\ncustom related lists.\n\u00a0To add fields in business card\n1. Go to\u00a0Setup > Customization > Modules and Fields.\n2. From the list of available modules, click the module for which you wish to create a new layout.\n3. In the\u00a0Module Layout\u00a0page, click\u00a0Detail View.\n4. In the\u00a0Business card, click\u00a0Customize.\n5. Select the fields. You can choose upto 5 fields.\n6. Click\u00a0Done.\nThe record detail page will display the customized business card.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\nTo customize related list fields\n1. In the\u00a0Detail View\u00a0page, scroll down to the\u00a0Record's Related List.\u00a0\n2. Click\u00a0Customize\u00a0> select\u00a0Fields\u00a0that you want to be displayed.\n3.

You could either rename the\nStandard Layout and customize it or clone it to create a new layout.\nThe difference between layouts must be clearly defined. For example, take a look at the Stage\nvalues of the two Deal layouts.\nFollowing are a few examples of most common differences between two layouts:\nDifferent fields and sections in the layouts.\nThe values of a pick-list field are different in the different layouts.\nDifference in mandatory fields\nwhile a field is mandatory in one layout\nit is non mandatory in\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\nAssign Layouts to User Profiles\nWhen you create multiple layouts, you can control how users view and access the layout. From Layout and Type\nAssignment, you can assign regular or Wizard layouts to profiles. See also Setting wizard as default layout.\nBesides assigning layouts to user profiles, you can also specify which layout must be the default layout for the\nprofile. The layout that a record belongs to can always be changed later, if required.\u00a0\nChoose layouts on record creation\nAfter you have created the layouts, you will be able to choose the layout at different record entry points. Some of\nthem are mentioned below. In our example, whenever you create a deal, you will be prompted to choose which\nlayout the deal has to be created in.\nDifference in mandatory fields \u2013 while a field is mandatory in one layout \u2013 it is non-mandatory in\nthe other.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\nCreating records individually\nImporting records\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\nRecords via web forms (leads/contacts/cases)\nRecords via APIs: \u00a0When records are pushed to CRM via APIs, they are pushed to the layout defined by the\nLayout ID in the API. If a layout is not defined for a record, it is assigned to the Standard Layout for the\nmodule.\nUnderstand the layout field\nWhen you create a new layout for a module, a system-generated field called\u00a0 Layout \u00a0gets created along with\nother fields automatically. The Layout field carries the layout name through which the record is generated in the\nNote\nIn the case of integrations offered by Zoho CRM such as Visitor Tracking, Zoho Books, Zoho\nSurvey, the leads/contacts are pushed to the Standard Layout of module.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\nlayout.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nSince the Layout field is another CRM field, you can use this field in various CRM functions such as creating\ncustom views, automation of record assignment, approval process and auto-follow rules.\nCreating custom views\nYou can create custom views based on the layout. For example, a custom view called\u00a0 Mobile Service deals \u00a0will\nenable a user to easily see all records that belong to the\u00a0 Mobile Service \u00a0layout.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\nAuto-follow rules\nYou can choose to auto-follow your peers\u2019 records that belong to particular layout. This way, you will be notified\nof any changes made to the record via Feeds in Zoho CRM.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\n\u00a0\nLead assignment rules\nYou can automate assignment of leads/contacts/cases to CRM users based on the layout that they belong to. For\nexample, you can create a rule that says all leads that belong to the\u00a0 Mobile Sales \u00a0layout should be assigned to a\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\nparticular sales rep.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nThis way, leads that come in via webforms and other third-party integrations such as Google Ads will be\nautomatically assigned to the user mentioned in the assignment rule. When an assignment rule is not mentioned,\nthe record will be automatically assigned to the Standard layout for the module.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\nApproval process automation\nYou can also automate the submission of records from a particular layout for approval by managers.\n\u00a0\u00a0 \nSetting up workflow rules\nZylker Mobiles requires several processes to be automated for the Deals modules.

Let us look at this case with an example.\nCustomers may sometimes return mobile phones they purchased for many reasons. In most cases, the reason for\nreturn is that their device was faulty. So in Zylker Mobiles, they decide to automatically move the return of faulty\ndevices from the\u00a0 Mobile sales \u00a0layout to their\u00a0 Mobile service \u00a0section.\nLet\u2019s say there is a field called \u201cReason for Return\u201d in the Mobile Sales layout. If this field is updated to \u201cFaulty\ndevice\u201d, the layout should be updated to Mobile Service.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\nResult of the rule\u00a0\nNow when the\u00a0 Reason for Return \u00a0field is updated to\u00a0 Faulty device , the record is automatically moved to the\u00a0\nMobile Service layout.\nCreate reports based on multiple layouts\nYou can also create reports and dashboards for a module based on the different layouts created for the module. For\nexample, the Zylker Mobiles team would like to know the sum of deals in the Mobile Services layout as against\nthat of the Mobile Sales layout.\nHere is a Summary report of deals grouped based on the Layout and the corresponding activity information.\u00a0\nHere is the report:\n\u00a0\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-page-layouts\nFrom the report, you can also create a dashboard for the same information.\n", "source": "create-page-layouts.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "calendar-booking", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/organization-settings/calendar\n-management/articles/calendar\n-booking\nZoho Corporation\nCalendar Booking\nCalendar booking comes in handy for the customer to book a meeting almost instantly. It allows customers to see\nwhen the support agents are available and\u00a0enables them to schedule a meeting or call independently.\nFor example, Travis has just purchased a software from Zylker and wants to schedule a\u00a0Product Demo\u00a0to gain in-\ndepth knowledge of its features. He mails the support team enquiring about the suitable time to have the product\ndemo scheduled. Now, Travis has to patiently wait for the confirmation from the support team. Various questions\npops in his head like, what if they didn't get my email? What if my email goes unnoticed? What if they schedule\nthe meeting when I am busy?\nTo avoid all these, by using Calendar Booking, a customer can choose the appropriate time for the meeting based\non their availability, enter the required details and voila! The meeting is booked. In case the customer is not\navailable at the time of the meeting, he can either reschedule or cancel the booking. This can help the customer\nbypass the series of calls or emails made to the support team and independently book a meeting with the\nrespective User or Team.\nOnce the setup is completed, a meeting URL is generated that can be shared with the customers allowing them to\nbook a\u00a0meeting. Calendar booking can\u00a0be categorized into two. They are as follows:\nTeam Booking\nUser Booking\nAvailability\nPermission Required\nUsers with permission to Manage Calendar Booking can create Team Booking and users with permission\nto create a Meeting or Call can create User Booking.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/organization-settings/calendar\n-management/articles/calendar\n-booking\nSetting up Calendar Booking\nTo set up calendar booking\n1.

Hover over the field and enter the field values in the Replace Empty Values text box.\nSometimes the field in an import file doesn't have a value, in case that field is marked mandatory in CRM,\nthe record will not be imported because of absence of value. To avoid such situations, you can mention an\nalternate value that will replace the empty field.\nFor example, you have mapped the Last Name field from the file with the Last Name field in the Leads\nmodule, which is mandatory. So without the field value, the record will be skipped during the import\nprocess. To avoid that, you can specify the value that should replace the empty Last Name field.\n16. Hover over the field and click the Add (+) icon next to the field name and map multiple fields in CRM with\na single field from the file.\u00a0\nFor example, if the Billing Address and the Shipping Address are same you can map both these CRM\nfields to the appropriate fields from the file.\n17. Click the Assign Default Values tab and select the CRM Fields with the appropriate Default field values.\u00a0\nOnce the values are specified, all the records will have the field value that you have specified by default.\nFor example, you are migrating a set of records to the Leads module and the Lead Source is common for\nall the records.

Can I set different set of mandatory fields in different layouts?\nYes, you can.\n6. Can I have different set of options for the Stage / pick list field in different layouts?\nYes, you can.\n7. When a layout is cloned, are the fields of the layout also cloned?\nYes. When you clone a layout, all the fields and sections along with the field and section properties are cloned to\nthe new layout. You can edit the new layout to make the desired changes.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/page-layout-faq\n8. Can a profile have multiple page layouts?\nYes, a profile can have access to more than one layout - however there can be only one default layout for a profile.\nTo manage layout assignment\n1. Go to Setup > Modules and Fields\u00a0>\u00a0Layout.\n2. Click the\u00a0Layout Assignment\u00a0button.\n3. In the\u00a0Layout Assignment\u00a0popup, assign layouts to each profile and select the default profile for each layout.\n4. For example, here, the profile Sales managers has access to 3 layouts, but only one layout can be set as the\ndefault layout for the profile - in this case,\u00a0Mobile Sales.\n5. This means that the users under the Sales managers profile can access all the three layouts but if they create\nrecords using the CRM mobile app, the records will be pushed to the Mobile Sales layout by default.\n9. If I change a field's properties in one layout, is it reflected in another layout where it is used?\nNo. If you change the field properties of a field in one layout, the changes are effective for that layout only.\n10. Why, am I not able to create a new layout.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/page-layout-faq\nFollowing are reasons why you may not be able to create a new layout\nYou are not in the Enterprise Edtion of Zoho CRM.\nYou do not have the Customize Zoho CRM permisison.\n11.

In the\u00a0Add options from other layouts\u00a0section, select the options required and click\u00a0Add.\nThe chosen picklist values will be added to the existing values.\n13. Are the picklist field values specific to profiles?\nThe picklist field values accessible to a user depends on the layout permission for the user. For example, if a\nmodule has 3 layouts with 5 different values each for a picklist field and a user has access only to two layouts,\nhe/she will have access only to 10 picklist values.\n14. Are the field permissions layout-specific?\nNo. The field permissions are not layout-specific. If you change the field permissions of a field in one layout,\nthese permissions apply for the field in other layouts of the module as well.\n15.

As a record\nowner, can he access and also edit the record?\nYes. Even if a layout of the record is not available to the owner of the record, he/she can access the record.\n19. I want to convert a lead to a contact. Say I convert a lead from Layout A. Can I map Layout\nA of Leads with Layout A of Contacts so that the layout assignment in Contacts is automated?\nCurrently field mapping for record conversion across layouts of two modules is not supported. However, this is on\nour roadmap. Watch this space for updates.\n20. If I delete a field from one layout, will it be deleted from another layout where it is used as\nwell?\nNo. If you delete a field from one layout, it will be pushed to the Unused Fields section for that layout. It will not\nbe deleted from another layout. You can bring a removed field back to the layout from the Unused Fields section.\n21.

Taking these steps improves the chances that their emails will be delivered and reduces\nthe likelihood that they'll be marked as spam or bounce back.\nWhat is a feedback loop?\nWhen businesses send a lot of emails from their CRM systems, sometimes those emails go to people who weren't supposed to\nreceive them. If these people mark the email as spam, their email service providers (like Outlook or Yahoo) tell the internet\nprovider. These providers then use this information to strengthen their spam filters and to judge how often the sender sends\nspam. If a sender gets multiple complaints, their future emails might be blocked or automatically sent to spam folders.\nTo help businesses avoid this scenario and improve how they send emails, most providers have a feedback loop system which\nnotifies senders or their email platforms (like Zoho CRM) of spam complaints.\nWhy is it important to sign up for a complaint feedback loop?\u00a0\nSigning up for a complaint feedback loop is crucial because it gives businesses valuable information about their email\nreputations. If an internet service provider or mailbox provider like Gmail blocks a business's emails, this feedback helps\nclarify why by showing who marked the emails as spam so they can avoid sending emails to these people in the future\u2014\nwhich can in turn improve their overall email practices and prevent future blocks.\nHow does Zoho CRM handle and respond to complaint feedback?\u00a0\nZoho CRM proactively manages email feedback by automatically\u00a0enrolling users in feedback loops for more than 25 email\nservices through a universal feedback loop, and also by tracking complaints from Outlook services.\u00a0This feedback is vital for\nmaintaining the reputation of the email IP addresses Zoho CRM uses to send users' emails.\nWhenever Zoho CRM receives a complaint report, it ensures that no future emails are sent to the flagged\u00a0email address. This\ncomplaint data is further fed into Zoho CRM's email credibility system, where businesses can find a dashboard that shows\ntheir email credibility scores and offers suggestions for improvement. By following these suggestions, businesses can reduce\nemail bounces and prevent spam filters from catching their emails.\nWhy should Zoho CRM users personally register for Yahoo's Complaint\nFeedback Loop?\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-tips-guidelines/articles/yahoo-complaint-feedback-loop\nYahoo operates a Complaint Feedback Loop (CFL) specifically designed for domain owners, which means that only the\nowner of a domain can sign up for Yahoo's CFL. During the registration process, Yahoo sends a unique code to the domain's\npostmaster address, which is required to complete the registration. This specific requirement means that Zoho CRM cannot\nautomatically register its users for Yahoo's CFL.\nIt's important that Zoho CRM users register their domains with Yahoo CFL themselves. By doing so, they can receive direct\nfeedback about any complaints from Yahoo email recipients. This feedback is crucial for maintaining a good email reputation\nand ensuring effective email delivery through Zoho CRM. The following section will guide you through the detailed process\nof registering your domain for Yahoo CFL.\nHow can a user register for yahoo feedback loop?\nBelow are the steps involved in preparing to registering a domain with Yahoo CFL:\n1. DKIM authentication: Make sure your domain is DKIM authenticated in Zoho CRM. This is necessary, because\nYahoo CFL only accepts emails that are DKIM authenticated. You can find more information about setting up DKIM\nauthentication in Zoho CRM\u00a0here.\n2. Set up a postmaster email: You need to have a postmaster email address for your domain (like\npostmaster@yourdomain.com). This is where Yahoo will send the unique code needed to complete the CFL registration\nprocess.\nBelow are the steps involved in registering for Yahoo CFL:\n1. Follow this URL: https://senders.yahooinc.com/complaint-feedback-loop\n2. Scroll down and click Enroll Now.\n3. Fill out the CFL registration form as shown below:\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-tips-guidelines/articles/yahoo-complaint-feedback-loop\nNote:\u00a0In the Reporting Email field, you should enter abuse@zohocrm.com for all DCs except Europe and use\nabuse@eu.zohocorp.com for EU DC, so that Yahoo will send complaint reports to Zoho CRM, allowing us to handle\ncomplaints and thereby improve your email credibility score (read more about email credibility in Zoho CRM here).\n4. Upon clicking Get Verification Code, you will receive an email with a verification code at your postmaster address\n(postmaster@<your-domain>).\n5. Copy and paste the verification code in the Yahoo CFL registration form.\n6. \u200b\nClick the Create Request button.\nOnce the request has been submitted to Yahoo, the domain will be enrolled into the Yahoo CFL system within 36 to 72 hours.\nAny spam reported Yahoo users report will be forwarded to the registered \"reporting email\". Please note that Yahoo will not\nsend any follow-up emails confirming the enrollment of your domain in the CFL.\n", "source": "yahoo-complaint-feedback-loop.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "customize-home-tab", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-home-tabs/articles/customize-home-tab\nZoho Corporation\nCustomizing Home Tab\nThe Home tab of Zoho CRM is a quick indicator of the progress of all your CRM activities.

For example, if the monthly target is set on the 15th, then you will get the results\nfrom 15th to 30th for that month. For the subsequent months the result will be displayed for the full calendar month (1st to 30th or 31st).\u00a0 \u00a0\n2.

Click Save.\nCreating Targets\u00a0\u00a0\nDepending on the KPI you can set daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly targets for individuals, teams, or the company. You can set multiple targets (up to 10) and certain\npoints will be awarded for each KPI and for each target. You can select a badge that will be awarded to target achievers.\u00a0\nTo create a target\n1. In the\u00a0 Motivator for Zoho CRM \u00a0 home page, click Targets from the left menu.\n2.

Click + to add more targets.\n7. Add a Badge.\n8. Click Save.\nViewing progress of the target\nFor each target, there is a status bar that displays the completion rate. A target board is created for each target that you have set for a KPI. Upon hovering over the target\nboard, you will find the option to refresh your targets to view the updated status.\nYou can also view whether your targets are on-track or off-track. This provides a more precise way of tracking targets, allowing users to keep their goals on track and on\nschedule. It helps filter out targets based on their completion status, enabling users to identify areas where progress has fallen behind (off-track) or areas where progress\nhas been made (on-track).\nFor example, take the \"Revenue to Generate\" component, which operates on a monthly scale. For a typical month lasting 31 days with an ambition of 27,000 points, the\ndaily target hovers around 870.9 points. To remain \"on-track\" by the 10th day, the cumulative tally should surpass 8,709.6 points. Achieving figures like 10,000 points by\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/organization-settings/sales-motivator/articles/using-motivator\n-for\n-zoho-crm\nthis 10th day ensures that the company stays ahead of the curve, and is accordingly categorized as on-track.\n\u00a0\nOn the other hand, the \"Leads Created\" component operates on a weekly basis. With its weekly target fixed at 21 points, let's say a\u00a0sales team should accrue\u00a0three points\neach day. Ideally, by the week's fourth day, they'll have amassed 12 points. However, if they've only gained nine points, their progress is categorized accordingly as off-\ntrack.\nFilter KPIs and Targets\u00a0\nFor ease of access, you can use the following filters to locate the desired KPI or target:\nModule: \u00a0You can select a module and view the KPIs and targets that were created for it.\nTime:\u00a0 Use a time-based filter to view the KPIs and targets created today or during the current month, week, quarter, or year.

You can decide the\nstart and end date for the game and set it to repeat every day, month, or year for a set period. This allows you to automatically repeat a game when the specified criteria for\nthe KPI is met.\nFor some particularly challenging milestones, you can select viewers who can watch the live game without participating.\u00a0\nOn the Games home page, the games are classified as ongoing, upcoming, and completed.\nOngoing game: \u00a0You can end an ongoing game whenever you want.

Not only does it serve to help you manage your layout to suit your business\nrequirements better, but it also ensures visual appeal by keeping clutter at bay.\u00a0\nImagine a sales agent handling data for a prospect interested in purchasing a commercial space from a real\nestate agency having to scroll through the residential properties section before he reaches the desired\nportion on the layout.\nOr a recruitment coordinator collating the details of a student interested in applying for Science, having to\nlook through the Arts and Commerce fields as well.\nWhile it is impossible for businesses/organizations/institutions to do away with these fields in their layouts, the\npresence of everything all together merely screams clutter.\u00a0\nWhy are Conditional Layouts required?\nIt is to evade clutter and make navigation through your layout easier, that Conditional layouts intend. Therefore,\nby creating a rule, you will be determining the necessity for a bunch of other fields. For instance, the sales agent\nfor the real estate company we mentioned earlier, will only be looking at commercial property requirements. And\nthe recruitment coordinator will not have to scroll through other course fields in Commerce or Arts while\nmanaging a Science applicant's data.\n\u00a0\nThis does not imply that we have done away with the other fields or sections, but that we have brought conditional\nlayouts into the picture to hide/show sections or fields based on a value entered in a previous field (as sales data is\noften inter-dependent). By selecting Commercial Properties under 'Type of Property', and Science Programs under\n'Bachelor's in', the agent for the real estate company and the recruiter from the university will only see commercial\nproperty and Science fields respectively.\nAs a result you can make your layouts dynamic - as the entire structure of a layout changes based on the field\nvalues you enter. In other words, you are controlling how a layout appears based on certain field values.\nTo understand the concept better, let us look at our examples (real estate and university) before and after the\napplication of Conditional Layouts:\n1. Real Estate:\na) Before the application of Conditional Layout\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/conditional-layouts-concept-and-benefits\nb) After applying Conditional Layout\n2. Educational Institution:\na) Before the application of Conditional Layout\nb) After applying Conditional Layout\nIt is therefore evident that the application of Conditional Layouts helps to make the layout more suitable for your\nbusiness requirements.\nBenefits of Conditional Layout\nSome of the common benefits of Conditional Layouts include:\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/conditional-layouts-concept-and-benefits\nAvoiding clutter: By limiting the number of fields or sections that are displayed on your form or layout,\nyou will be able to avoid clutter.\nSetting Mandatory Fields: You can set mandatory fields based on values that you may have entered in a\nprevious field.\nBefore we proceed to understand the concept of Conditional Layouts, let us look at an example of setting\nmandatory fields with the help of this feature.\nOne of the sections in Zylker University's form is that of Hostel Requirements. This covers all aspects including\nhealth related fields such as food allergies, other allergies, handicap, etc. Now, when a recruiter selects Yes under\n\"Allergies\", the university requires that the \"Type of Allergies\" field be made mandatory. This can be achieved by\napplying Conditional Layouts.\na. Before the application of Conditional Layout\nb. After applying Conditional Layout\nConditional Layouts - Concept\nTo understand the concept of Conditional Layouts better, let us consider a scenario.\nZylker Insurance offers motor insurance products such as car insurance and commercial vehicle insurance.\nIn this case, if Zylker includes all these details in a single form/layout, there is a slight difficulty. That is, when a\ncustomer needs a policy for a car, the form unnecessarily asks for details regarding commercial vehicles as well.\nObserve the details in the table below:\nField\nPrivate Car\nCommercial Vehicle\nPurpose for which vehicle will be\nused\n\u2718\n\u2714\nNature of goods normally carried\n\u2718\n\u2714\nType of Permit (Goods Carrying\nVehicle)\n\u2718\n\u2714\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/conditional-layouts-concept-and-benefits\nType of Permit (Passenger Carrying\nVehicles)\n\u2718\n\u2714\nHazardous Substances Description\n\u2718\n\u2714\nThe above table lists fields that are required for a Commercial vehicle, indicating that this entire section in the\nform becomes unnecessary the moment the customer chooses \"Private Car\". This only causes clutter and\ndiscourages the applicant from filling out the form.\nHowever, when conditional layouts are applied, we can achieve a dynamic setup, wherein, in the case of Zylker\nInsurance, when a prospect selects \"Private Car\", only the said type details appear, and the Commercial Vehicle\ndetails remain hidden and vice versa. This way, you can optimize your forms.\nTo understand how to create a layout rule, go here:\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-\nconditional-layouts#Create_layout_rules\n", "source": "conditional-layouts-concept-and-benefits.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "email-configuration-for-imap-and-pop3", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/user\n-functions/articles/email-configuration-for\n-imap-and-pop3\nZoho Corporation\nEmail Configuration for IMAP and POP3\nZoho CRM supports email integration from any email service through IMAP and POP3 protocols, allowing for\nseamless synchronization and management of email communication within the platform.

A step-wise approach is less\u00a0overwhelming and reduces chances of\nerroneous data entry, as the partially completed form can be saved as draft and submitted later.\u00a0\nYou can extend the support of wizards to the external collaborators and stakeholders like customers, partners, or\nanyone with the portal access. They could create, edit, update and delete records based on the permissions. Users\ncan also track the status of the record.\nWizards are typically helpful when:\nyou want your CRM or portal users to complete the form only in a systematic sequence.\nthere are several steps involved in accomplishing something.\nyou want users to be able to save the form as a draft before submitting\nAvailability\nRecommended use cases\nDisplaying different sections of a record such as user details, employment history, educational qualification,\ninsurance details etc., in single view can cause confusion. Instead, showing each section as separate buttons in the\nhome screen will allow the sales reps or portal users to navigate between the sections easily based on the\nrequirements.\u00a0\nThis approach can be helpful in processes where the application forms are extensive and\u00a0the user wish to skip a\nfew details\u00a0at the moment like loan application, property selection, visa submission etc.\u00a0\nPermission Required\nUsers with Administrative profile can create, edit, and delete Wizards.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nInsurance form:\u00a0A simple, interactive form for purchasing insurance makes filling forms much easier and\nsmoother. You can embed your software application into the wizard using widgets, and allow the record creator to\ncheck if the applicant has other insurances with your company or whether his application was rejected in the past\nand the reason of rejection. So, while creating the record, the user can access the company's database to verify\ninformation before saving the record.\u00a0\nAgain, data collection in this industry can be exhaustive as the flow is decided on the type of insurance and every\nsmall detail like medical history (for medical insurance) or vehicle details (for vehicle insurance) should be\nessentially captured. Data collection happens at multiple points such as insurance claims, applying for\nreimbursements, etc. Customers could use wizards with their portal access and fill up forms for such tedious\ndetails with ease and error free.\nCustomers can also use it to track details like last date of monthly payment, change the plans and know the\nestimated amount that can be claimed based on the damage occurred. Having portals in wizards makes the entire\nprocess easier and faster.\u00a0\nUniversity admission form:\u00a0The application form for admission to university is much comprehensible and clutter\nfree with the help of a wizard. Separate screens are used to capture additional details like projects, presentations\netc. which reduces the chances of overseeing important details during submission. The database can be embedded\nin the wizard, to enable the record creator to auto-populate the admission number and registration id of an existing\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nuser using the widget.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nProduct purchase form:\u00a0A product order form is divided into different screens to accommodate orders from\ndifferent products. This way the agents can directly open the product order form for which the customer wants to\nplace an order. In addition to this, the agents can check if the product delivery is available in a particular area with\nthe help of custom button without having to leave the wizard screen.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBanking industry:\u00a0In banking, data collection is required at almost every step. We can create portals for\ncustomers which they can use for applying for loans, debit/credit cards, account closing requests etc.\nFree delivery for a given pin code:\u00a0The system checks for free delivery availability when a user enters a pin\ncode. The resulting message is shown inline to the field or in a pop-up.\n\u00a0\nWeb check-in:\u00a0The wizard is designed for the check-in module, and the passenger is the related module. The\nquery is to find the passenger with a specific PNR in the passenger module and associate them with the check-in\nmodule status.\n\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nHospital appointment booking:\u00a0The fetch record will query for the mobile number entered by the patient and\ncheck it in the registration module. If the record is found, the patient proceeds to book an appointment. If not, a\nnew patient record is created with the filled phone number to proceed with booking an appointment.\nCreating a wizard\u00a0\nIn Zoho CRM, you can customize the\u00a0record detail page\u00a0using wizards, to segment a single form into several\nconcise\u00a0segments. Each section will appear as a screen and the user can navigate across the screens using buttons\nsuch as\u00a0next, save, more etc.\u00a0You can create wizards in both\u00a0standard and custom modules and also across\ndifferent layouts (you can add upto 4 layouts).\u00a0\nYou can select the fields that should appear in each section and use different formatting options to design a unique\nform (wizard) to suit your business requirements. A wizard consists of the following elements:\nFields\u00a0-\u00a0All the fields, sections, and\u00a0subforms that you have added to the layout will be displayed under the\nFields tab.\u00a0You can drag and drop the desired fields into each segment. You can also toggle to add the record\nimage in the wizard.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nNote that, you cannot create a field from\u00a0this screen.\nComponents \u00a0- You can add a single-line text component, widget, or query component to the wizard. You can\nadd up to five text components, one widget, and one query component on a wizard screen.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nText: In the text component you can use merge fields to display the record-related information for the\nusers.\u00a0\nFor example, a message can be displayed to the record owner stating that the address details for the\nparticular record have been successfully added. Using merge fields the exact field values will be\nreflected in the message.\nWidget: Using widget you can pass information from Wizard to Widget and vice-versa. Only while\npassing information from widget to wizard the following API must be used in the widget SDK:\nZOHO.CRM.WIZARD. Post(data) [data is a JSON object that contains the value that needs to be\npopulated in the record].\ndata=\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\n{\nfield_api_name: field_value\n}\nExample: The below API will pass the last name and first name of the customer from a widget to the wizard.\u00a0\nZOHO.CRM.WIZARD.Post(\n{\n\u201cLast_Name\u201d: \u201cBrooks\u201d,\n\u201cFirst_Name\u201d: \u201cNathan\u201d,\n\u201c);\nQuery:\u00a0The Query component in Wizards is designed to aid users in managing and gathering data more\nefficiently by providing predetermined actions based on the results of a search query. The Query\ncomponent operates as a search field with a search parameter and a preset comparator, which is\nsubsequently matched against a field in the current or related module.\nThe query component includes various functionalities that can be used in different ways. For example,\nwhen matching records are found in a query search, you can configure actions to:\nChoose a record from a set of eligible options and save it in a lookup field.\nNavigate to any specific screen.\nDisplay a widget on the present screen.\nDisplay a popup message.\nDisplay a message within a text element.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nDisplay an in-line message within a field.\nAgain, if the search in the query component fails to find matching records, you have the option to\ncreate a record in the current or related module, besides the actions described above.\nEach action may have an added static sub-criteria to decide whether the action needs to be\ntriggered.\nThe component is designed to be repurposed within any wizard belonging to the same module,\nwith only the actions section being editable. The target field and comparator aspect of the\ncomponent remains constant.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nButtons\u00a0 - Buttons can be used to save a record or to link different screens.\u00a0On a single screen, you can add\nup to 10 buttons. You can use only one button to link a screen. Depending on the action that you want these\nbuttons to perform, you can name them:\u00a0Save, Next, Edit, Product name etc. You can specify if a button\nshould be used to save a record by checking the\u00a0Use this button to save the record\u00a0option.\u00a0For example, you\ncan check this option to ensure that the record is saved when the\u00a0Done,\u00a0Submit\u00a0or\u00a0Save\u00a0button is clicked by\nthe user.\nAlso, you can toggle the Show acknowledgement message button to display a message when the user clicks\non the Save button. Additionally, you can use merge fields to display personalized messages in the\nacknowledgement message.\nNotes:\nOnly one query component is allowed per screen, whereas each wizard can accommodate up to five\nquery components.\nA maximum of 3 query components can be created per module.\nEach screen of the wizard should contain only one query component.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nFor each button, you can define the visibility, style, and actions.\nVisibility \u00a0-\u00a0 You can set the visibility of the button\u00a0to:\u00a0always show,\u00a0hide button or\u00a0disable button.\nAlso, you can set conditions when the button should be hidden or disabled, for example, if the\ncorrespondence address and email address fields are empty the\u00a0Next button should be disabled/hidden.\nStyle \u00a0-\u00a0 You can select the shape of the button as normal, rounded or curved. Additionally, choose\u00a0from\nthe most frequently used colors, or \u00a0use the multi-picker to choose advanced colours to suit your brand\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nrequirements.\nActions \u00a0-\u00a0 You can set actions like sending email notifications to the record owner whenever\nthe\u00a0Submit button is clicked. You can also set actions using webhooks or write your custom actions.\nFor example, you can write a webhook to notify the students when their application form is submitted\nto the university portal.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nCustom Buttons -\u00a0 These buttons can be used to perform specific actions that involve fetching data from\nCRM modules, third-party applications or other Zoho apps. For example, using a custom button you can:\u00a0\nCheck if the customer is authorized for a trade license. You can fetch relevant information from the\nlocal municipal body during record creation or editing in the wizard.\nVerify the customer details and autofill information from the third-party website into your CRM fields.\u00a0\nSend information about the record to other apps for further processing. If a certain process requires the\ncustomer to submit documents for further processing, then the agent (record creator in CRM) can hit\nthe submit button after uploading the necessary documents which will pass the information on to the\nthird-party app.\u00a0\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nNotes:\nFields that are present in the selected layout in Wizards will be displayed in merge fields.\nIf a field added as a merge field in Wizard is removed from the original layout, the merge field\nvalue will be displayed as\u00a0${Unsupported_Field}\u00a0\nIf the field values are empty or if the values are removed, the merge field in the text component of\nthe acknowledgment message will be displayed as a blank value.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\n\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nPoints to remember w.r.t custom buttons\nA custom button can be used to save a record.\u00a0\nYou can add only ONE custom button on a screen.\nYou CANNOT link a custom button to a screen.\u00a0\nOnly those buttons that have been created under the wizard placement during the creation of\ncustom buttons will be available in a wizard. Read more\n\u00a0\nYou can allow selected profiles to access the button. For example, only the regional sales managers\ncan submit customer documents to the municipal body for the processing of trading license, then\nyou can restrict other users from accessing the custom button. To facilitate this, you can set the\nbutton permission as regional sales manager only. This way, users from other profiles will not be\nable to view the button (they will be able to view the wizard and other buttons based on profile\npermission).\nYou can set the visibility (show, hide or disable) and style for the button.\u00a0\nButton-based actions cannot be set for a custom button. For example, unlike buttons custom buttons\ncannot automate email notifications, webhook or custom actions.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nTo create a wizard\nThe custom button actions will be defined by the function that you have created for the button\nduring creation. For example, a button can invoke a URL, open a web tab, perform any custom\naction etc.\u00a0 \u00a0\nThe custom button is not supported in copy customization. Hence, during copy customization, if a\ncustom button is a save button we will change it to a regular button. Any other button will be\nremoved from the wizard and the wizard will be disabled. The user can enable it.\nFunctions in a Custom button support the following 4 keys:\ni. 'reloadRecord' - used to reload the CRM UI when some data has been changed through a\ncustom button.\nii. 'message' - user can be shown a message every time a custom button is executed. A\ntransaction's success or failure can be shown as a popup notification.\niii. 'status' - the key can be used to prevent a record from being saved due to any logical failure\nafter the execution of the custom button.\niv. 'isCascadeEnabled' - can be used to pass data from one custom button to another. If there\nare two custom buttons then this key will help pass response from the first custom button to\nthe next button if this key is enabled. The response will be available in the\n'cascadedResponses' key.\u00a0\nTips\u00a0\nMake note of the following points while creating a wizard to prevent errors.\n1. Avoid looping of screens, that is if screen 1 > screen 2 > screen 3 > screen 4 > screen 2 is\nconnected in this manner, you will not be able to save the wizard. The path should be defined in\nsuch a way that the record creator doesn't come across the same screen again.\u00a0\n2. Avoid repetition of fields. If a field is added to screen 1 then do not reuse it in the subsequent\nscreens. This is mainly done to prevent users from entering values in the same field again. For\nexample, if you have already added \"company name\" in screen 2 you shouldn't add it again in\nscreen 3. However, you can add it if the screens are arranged in such a manner that the record\ncreator fills the value only once. For example, if a button on screen 1 directs to screen 3 then the\nrecord creator will see the \"company name\" field only once.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\n1.

Follow steps 6 onwards to add fields and buttons to the subsequent screens.\n9. Click\u00a0Save Wizard.\u00a0\nCreating Conditional Rules\nConditional Rules inside Wizards let you create dynamic changes to your forms based on user's input. It is defined\nby a set of criteria and actions. Criteria are conditions, describing the values of the field that needs to be satisfied.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nA list of actions that can be performed when a criterion is met are:\nChoose when to apply the conditional rule: You can select whether the conditional rules will be applied\nonly when the wizard is created, edited, or either of them. This would stop applying the rule every time a\nrecord is edited.\nSet Mandatory Fields:\u00a0Select the fields to be set as mandatory\nSet value: Based on some pre-defined conditions, value can be set for fields.\nNOTE: System mandatory fields will not be available in the Set Value field options.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nLock specific fields:\u00a0You can lock fields when a criterion is met. In the case of fields like a permanent\naccount number that should not be modified every time you are editing a wizard, can simply be locked.\nUpon locking fields, you will have the option to allow edits to specific profiles. You can simply select the\nprofiles that should have permission to edit even the locked fields if necessary.\nShow Subform, Text Components and Widget:\u00a0You will have the choice to show or hide the available\nsubforms, text components, and widgets available on the particular screen. You can also set titles for the text\ncomponent.\nLet's have a look at a few examples where conditional rules could help meet your specific needs:\n1. Display specific insurance-based fields, based on the different insurance types:\nOne insurance form can be used for automobile and health insurance. While creating the record, the user\ncan access the form with basic contact details and the Insurance type. Depending on the Insurance Type\nentered the relevant insurance fields are shown.\u00a0\n2. Display a set of discount options, depending on the user's answer to the region name:\nA common order form can be used to place orders from different regions of the country.\u00a0\u00a0Depending on the\nregion entered in a \"Region Name\" text field, a picklist containing a list of discounts available for the\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nspecific region can be displayed. So on entering a region such as South America a picklist of \"South\nAmerica discounts\" will be displayed with a set of discount options.\n3. Showing a guest list subform to only attendees who choose to bring additional guests:\nA Subform Guest Details is used to create a list of extra guests on an Event Registration form. This needs to\nappear only when attendees choose to bring guests. So, when the field \"Bringing extra guests to the event\"\nis checked, the subform \"Guest Details\" will appear.\n4. In the case of the loan application form, there is a due date field which is filled with the expected date to\npay the EMI based on the current date. In case of some edits in the record for other fields like address\nchange or phone number change, the condition will be executed again and the due date field will be updated\nbased on the current date. Which ideally shouldn't be the case. This could be solved by specifying when a\nparticular condition should be executed.\n5. In the visa application form, based on the purpose of the visit the visa type will be filled. When the record is\nedited it should again execute the condition and fill in the type of visa to avoid any errors while filling or\nediting the form.\u00a0\nTo create a conditional rule:\n1. Go to the Wizard's design page.\n2. Click the Set up conditional rule link.\n3. Click the +Create Conditional Rule button.\n4. In the Conditional\u00a0Rule popup,\ni. Set the rule trigger \u2014 Create and Edit, Create, Edit.\nii. Define the condition.\niii. Select the fields from the multi-select picklist Show fields.\niv.

However, note that\nthe layout permission will override the wizard access permission. That is, if the sales reps or portal user types\nhave restricted access to layout A, then even though they have permission to access the wizard, they will be\nunable to view the layout. Therefore, you must\u00a0make sure the profiles that you give access to wizards have layout\npermissions enabled.\nTo manage wizard permission\n1. Click\u00a0Manage Permission\u00a0on the top panel on the wizard design page.\n2. Choose the profiles, portal user types and click\u00a0Done.\nYou can edit the permissions by adding/removing profiles after setting up the wizard.\nPoints To Remember:\n1. In case a value is set for a particular field, the conditional rule will be prioritised over the value\nadded manually.\n2. When a mandatory field is selected, and it is also the field locked in the conditional rule setup, then\nif the user has not set a value for it, there will be a mismatch and the user will not be able to save\nthe record (empty value for mandatory field).\n3. If the same field which is part of the criteria is used in the set value along with show actions, then\nthe field will be shown and the value will be set.\n4. When a field is locked and another conditional rule is triggered to set a value for the same field,\nthen the field will not get updated (Exception - This behaviour does not apply to profiles with allow\nthe edit to access).\n5. Conditional rules will be prioritised over map dependency fields.\u00a0\u00a0\nMeans of updating fields in CRM\nDetails of field update\nImport\nUpdated on importing new leads or overwriting\nexisting records\nWorkflow rules\nUpdated as a result of workflow action\nApproval Process\nApproval process field update takes precedence\nover a set value\nAPIs\nUpdated via API update records\u00a0method\nMass update\nIf the criteria for set value is satisfied by the\nvalue given in mass update, the conditional rule\nwill not be executed.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nThe details of the profiles and portal user types who have access to a particular wizard will be available on the\nwizard list view page.\nSetting Wizards as Default Layout\nIf you have created regular layouts and wizards in a module and want a particular profile to view the wizard\nlayout by default, then you can mark the wizard as the default layout for that profile.\u00a0\nFor example, if you want the Sales profile to view the registration form whenever they create a new record, you\ncan select the wizard as the default layout.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/wizards/articles/wizards\nTo assign wizard as the default layout\n1.\u00a0Go to Setup > Customization > Modules and Fields and select the module.\n2.\u00a0Click the More icon and select Layouts.\n3. In the Layouts page, click Layout and Type Assignment.\n4. For each layout, under Set Layout Types select Regular layout or Wizard layout from the drop-down\nlist.\n5. Click the radio button to Mark a layout as default.\u00a0\nAssigning a default layout doesn't restrict the users from viewing other layouts or wizards while creating\na record.

The user must select the desired wizard layout from the drop-down list within the module and add the\nrecord's details, the buttons will guide them to navigate through the entire form.\u00a0\nTo avoid getting errors while saving a wizard, be sure to do the following:\ni. We have listed out all the mandatory fields: system-defined and user-defined mandatory\nfields, separately under the\u00a0Fields\u00a0tab for easy identification. Make sure you add these fields\nto the\u00a0screens before saving the wizard.\u00a0\nii. Assure that you don't have orphaned screens or buttons.

Enter the details in\nthe first screen and continue to navigate based on the details you want to enter.\nEditing records through Wizards\nRecords that were created using Wizards can be edited using the Wizard layout. For example, an insurance form\nthat is created on a wizard layout can be edited by the agents in the same layout.\u00a0\nSaving records as draft\nYou can save a record whose details are partially filled as a\u00a0draft and enter the remaining details later. These forms\ncan be accessed by clicking on the\u00a0Drafts option from the\u00a0 More icon in the module list view.\u00a0 Once the record is\nsaved it will be removed from the drafts and added to the list view.

Importing records from such external sources to Zoho CRM is one of the most\nimportant lead creation activities in any business. For that reason, importing should be easy and should help you\nmaintain clean data without duplicates.\nData Import into Zoho CRM | Data Migration\nData Import into Zoho CRM | Data Migration\nYou can import your data using either of the two options mentioned below:\nImporting data to individual modules in Zoho CRM : Individual files can be imported, one at a time, to a\nspecific module.\nMigrating data from other accounts to Zoho CRM : The\u00a0 Data Migration \u00a0wizard helps you to migrate data\nfrom other CRM systems to Zoho CRM. The wizard enables you to attach the CSV file of the module to be\nmigrated and set the supported Date and Time format in the import file to avoid values being ignored during the\nmigration. You can also ask Zoho CRM to notify you when the import is complete by selecting the\u00a0 Send Email\nNotification \u00a0option. After the necessary details are specified, you will need to map all the mandatory fields in the\nCSV file with those in Zoho CRM.\u00a0 See Also\u00a0 Migrate Data\nAvailability\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/import-data/articles/import-data\nImport Checklist\nBefore importing the data, please go through the following checklist:\n1. Permission\u00a0\nMake sure you have the access and privilege to Import data. If you do not have this permission, the Import\nlink will be hidden in your user interface.\n2. File Format\u00a0\nThe supported formats are\u00a0 Excel (XLS, XLSX), Comma Separated Value (CSV), and Business Card or\nvCard\u00a0 Format \u00a0(VCF) . All file attachments should be separated from the data.\nUnexpected errors may occur if the XLS/XLSX files contain any special controls such as combo filters or\nimages embedded in them.\n3. Characters not allowed\nAny data for the file to be imported should not contain data enclosed in <script> </script>.\n4. Mandatory Fields\u00a0\nEach required (mandatory) field must contain a value. Make sure you do not leave any mandatory fields\nblank, in the import file. For instance, when you are importing account information, each account record must\ninclude an\u00a0 Account Name . Please note that you cannot proceed to the next step without mapping the\nmandatory fields.\n5. Check box Data\nMake sure that the data you plan to import from Boolean or check box fields contain values that will properly\nconvert during the import process.\nImported data from Boolean and check box fields are converted as follows:\nIf check box is selected: True or 1\nIf check box is not selected: False or 0\n6. Drop-down List\u00a0\nAll data values displayed in the drop-down lists must exist in the corresponding Zoho CRM fields.\nFor instance, if you plan to import account information that contains a value for the industry type drop-down\nlist, before you import the account information, make sure all the industry values in the source file already\nappear in the drop-down list. If the values do not exist, you must either change the values in the source file to\nmatch the existing values in Zoho CRM, or have your administrator add the new values.\nPermission Required\nUsers with Import permission in their profile can access this feature.\u00a0\nCheck Feature Availability and Limits\u00a0\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/import-data/articles/import-data\nIf values are not added in the drop-down list, data can still be imported. After importing, if you change the\nvalue for the field, you cannot change it back to the old one as it will not be available in the list.\n7. Field Names\u00a0\nMake sure the first row of data (records) in the source file contains the column headings or field names rather\nthan the actual data values. These heading field name values help identify the data when you map the new\ndata to the existing fields in Zoho CRM.\n8. Blank rows in the import file\u00a0\nMore than 10 blank rows in the file might indicate the end of the file. Data after the blank rows will be\nignored during import. Make sure not to leave blank rows in between rows of data.\n9. File Size\u00a0\nMake sure the file size\u00a0does not exceed the following\u00a0limits according to your edition of Zoho CRM:\nCSV files:\u00a0Enterprise and Ultimate -\u00a0 25 MB , Professional and Standard -\u00a0 10 MB , Free -\u00a0 5 MB.\nVCF files:\u00a0 5 MB \u00a0for all editions.\n10. Rows\nNumber of rows that can be imported depends on the edition:\nStandard - 10,000; Professional - 20,000; Enterprise - 30,000; Ultimate - 50,000.\n11. External field\nAny field present in the .CSV file can be mapped with an external field present in the CRM module. The\nvalue of the external ID field can be updated only through API.\u00a0\nThe modules along with their Zoho-defined mandatory fields are described in the table below. Please make sure to\nmap these fields when you import. There maybe other mandatory fields in each module too, but you can always\ncustomize and mark the fields as non-mandatory, if required.\nModules\nMandatory Fields\nModules\nMandatory Fields\nLeads\nLast\u00a0 Name\nCases\nCase Origin\nSubject\nStatus\nAccounts\nAccount Name\nSolutions\nSolution Title\nContacts\nLast Name\nPrice Books\nPrice Book Name\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/import-data/articles/import-data\nDeals\nDeal Name\nDate\nClosing Date\nProducts\nProduct Name\nCampaigns\nCampaign Name\nVendors\nVendor Name\nImport Limits\nIf the import file is in .XLS, .XLSX or .VCF format, you can import a maximum of 5000 records/batch for all\nCRM editions.

To avoid such situations, you can\nmention an alternate value that will replace the\u00a0empty field.\u00a0\nFor example,\u00a0you have mapped the\u00a0Last Name field from the file with the Last Name field in the\u00a0Leads\nmodule, which is mandatory. So\u00a0without the field value, the record will be skipped during the import\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/import-data/articles/import-data\nprocess.

On the next page, you can\nselect the layout (if any) in which the subform records will be added. You then choose either to add the records as\nnew subform entries, update existing entries, or both, and then select which existing records should be skipped, if\nany.\nAdd as new subform: Choose this option to import the records in the import file as new entries in the\nmodule.\u00a0In order to avoid data duplication, you have the option to skip records from the file that\nmatch existing records.\nUpdate existing only: Choose this option to make changes only to the existing records.\u00a0This option\nhelps you filter existing records that need to be updated.\nBoth: Choose this option to update the changes in the existing records and add new records if there\nare any.

They\nkeep track of every customer's preferences, their customized orders, preferred chefs and in not-so-rare cases their\ndiet restrictions too!\u00a0\nHis job doesn't end here. He needs to be on top of several other transactions like raw material purchase, monthly\nexpenditures, annual growth, and profit tracking too.

Your CRM data are often inter-dependent. You may have the necessity to associate multiple items\nto a single record. In technical terms, we call these \"line items\". A subform allows to associate multiple line items\nto a single record.\u00a0\nFor example, while ordering a mobile phone, a customer may place the order for accessories such as mobile\ncharger, flip cover and a microphone - along with the main product. So, these become \"sub-products\". While\ncustomer A orders these three accessories, customer B may order another 5. Each accessory may require essential\ninformation such as amount, rate, quantity, discount and so on.\nAssociate multiple line items to a record | Subforms\nAssociate multiple line items to a record | Subforms\nThis\u00a0Accessories\u00a0section in itself becomes a form - where you ask for details such as name of the accessory, price,\nquantity, vendor and so on. So essentially you have two forms:\nA\u00a0primary product\u00a0form, which contains details about the main order: mobile phone.\nA\u00a0sub product\u00a0form, which contains details about the associated accessories. This is nothing but\na\u00a0subform\u00a0in CRM.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/managing-subforms/articles/build-subforms\nOn a more technical perspective, subforms easily solve the need for you to establish a one-to-many relationship\nwith data in your CRM, in which many secondary items are associated to a single primary record. The following\n\"Scenarios\" section offers examples from many industries to illustrate the purpose of a subform.\nScenarios\nSubforms can be used in various scenarios. Some of them are outlined below:\nSales Sector: A subform to associate contact details to accounts\nIf you have many contacts that you are working with in a specific company, create a subform to jot down the\ndetails of the contacts.\nEducation Sector: A subform to associate academic details to a student\nA Student application form may require the applicant to fill a complete section on Academic Details and Previous\nemployment details, if any. This may contain details about the employer, job title, description and so on. While the\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/managing-subforms/articles/build-subforms\nprimary form is still all about the student, the subform is a table with details about previous companies and\nassociated information.\nInsurance Sector: A subform to associate dependent details to an applicant\nA life insurance form may ask an applicant to fill dependent details - this section would be a form in itself with\ndetails required such as Dependent Name, Age, Sex and other identity related information. While the primary\nform is still about the insurance policy holder, the subform is a table with details about his/her dependents.\nReal Estate Sector: A subform to associate References details in a rental application\nform\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/managing-subforms/articles/build-subforms\nA house rental or lease form could contain a section on Floor Plans. These could require details such as\napartments, description, area etc. While the primary form is still about a property, the sub form could be about\ndetails about the houses under this property.\nRetail Sector: A subform to associate products in invoices and orders\nA manufacturing company can customize the invoice and orders to include fields like sale price, product\nrecommended retail price, buying price, formula field to calculate profit or discounts, etc. in the product line item\nin the Inventory modules.\u00a0\nBuilding a subform\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/managing-subforms/articles/build-subforms\nA subform is created using the layout editor. You will insert the required types of fields as \"Columns\" in a\nsubform and add aggregate fields if required. The following sections break down the process of creating a\nsubform in Zoho CRM.\nTo create a subform\n1. Go to\u00a0Setup\u00a0>\u00a0Customization\u00a0>\u00a0Modules and Fields.\n2. From the list of modules, click the required module and layout. Example:\u00a0Products module, Standard\nlayout.\n3. In the layout editor, drag and drop the\u00a0Subform\u00a0block from the\u00a0New Fields\u00a0section on the left.\n4. Name the subform: Example:\u00a0Sub Products.\u00a0\nNote that subforms are layout-specific. You can have entirely different subforms for Layout A and Layout B\nof the same module.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/managing-subforms/articles/build-subforms\nInserting columns in a subform\nIn the subform, you must next insert the columns required. These columns are nothing but the different types of\nfields such as single line, number, currency, formula, pick-list field, file upload field, lookup, user field, and so on.\nAssociation of fields from a lookup module\nWhen you add a lookup field to a subform, you can also include fields of the lookup module. For example, when\nyou add\u00a0Vendors\u00a0as the lookup module, you will be able to add fields from this module - \"Vendor Email\" and the\nlike. As you fill line items in this subform, you will see that the Vendor Email field is automatically populated as\nyou look up a vendor. You can edit this field in the subform any time.\nSimilarly, you can have a user field Product Engineer for the different tent models available. Along with it, you\ncan have other related fields like Email, Country, etc. from the users module listed, and add them further as\ncolumns in the subform. Updating the Product Engineer field will automatically update the following fields.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/managing-subforms/articles/build-subforms\nNote that while you can associate\u00a0fields from the lookup module\u00a0to a subform, they are not in sync with the\nsubform. That is, when you change a Vendor Email field, it is modified in the subform but not in the original\nVendor module. This is because, you only make an association here, but not synchronization.\n\u00a0\nTo insert columns in a subform\nNote:\nFields of lookup module will not be populated upon lead conversion, Quote conversion, updating\nthrough API, Data Migration, Import, etc.\nUser Lookup field is not supported for inventory modules.\nAllow Record Accessibility (Associated users will get access to the records) is not supported on\nsubform user fields.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/managing-subforms/articles/build-subforms\n1. In your subform, click\u00a0Add Field.\u00a0\n2. From the\u00a0Field Type\u00a0drop-down list, click the required type of field.\n3. Name the field and set\u00a0field properties.\nIn case you insert a lookup field, you can add specific fields from the related lookup module.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/managing-subforms/articles/build-subforms\nFollowing are the type of fields you can include in a subform as the form's \"Columns\".\nSingle Line\nPick List\nDecimal\nMulti-Line\nMulti-Select Pick List\nPercent\nEmail\nDate\nLong Integer\nPhone\nDate/Time\nCheckbox\nNumber\nCurrency\nURL\nLookup\nFormula\nUser\nFile Upload\nHere is a sample subform for a company that sells mobile phones. While a phone is their primary order, there\ncould be sub products that include accessories. This subform includes columns such as the following:\nName of the accessory\nVendor (Lookup field)\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/managing-subforms/articles/build-subforms\nVendor Email (Field from Lookup module)\nRate\nQuantity\nPrice\nDiscount\nAmount.\nInserting an aggregate field\nAn aggregate field allows for a mathematical function to be performed on a set of data. After the necessary\ncolumns are included in your form, an aggregate field can be integrated. This is particularly useful in situations\nlike tracking mobile sales, where accessory details are listed in a subform labeled \"Sub-Products\", which might\nencompass data fields like quantity, price, description, discount, and more.\nTypes of Aggregate fields\nPredefined aggregate functions\nThese functions, such as SUM, AVERAGE, MAXIMUM, and MINIMUM, are readily available in the\nsystem. If you want to sum the price column of all items, an aggregate field named \"Total Amount\" can be\nintroduced and SUM applied as its function to the Price column. As line items are entered into the \"Sub-\nProducts\" subform, prices are automatically summed.\nCondition-Based aggregate fields: You can also set conditions for the predefined aggregate field such that\nthe aggregation of field values will happen based on specific criteria. You will have the option to aggregate\nvalues from all rows or only from those that meet a specified condition.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/managing-subforms/articles/build-subforms\nFor example, a quote containing rows for mobile devices sold and accessories sold along with it, you can set\nconditions such that the aggregate field will show the aggregate only for mobile devices.\nFormula Functions\nFor any other function apart from the predefined aggregate functions, you can define your own Formula\nExpression using the Formula Tab. For example, your Total Amount field is not a Sum of the total prices\nbut\u00a0Sum of Total Prices - Discount + Tax. This expression can be defined in the Formula Section\nappropriately.\nWhen line items are entered in the Subproducts subform, the entered function will be executed\nautomatically.\nManual entries (New Fields)\nIn cases where you don't want the system to make these aggregate calculations, you can add a\u00a0New\nField.\u00a0This new field can be a Currency Field, Number or Decimal Field. For example, you want to have an\naggregate field called\u00a0Adjustments, where entries are made on an ad-hoc basis manually. In this case, you\ncan choose New Field, choose the type of field- say currency and add it as an aggregate field.\nTo insert a predefined aggregate field\n1. Click + Add Aggregate Field within the subform.\n2. On the Aggregate Fields popup, go to Aggregate.\n3. Field Label: Enter the name of the field.\n4.

Some of the major\nerrors include:\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/portals/articles/sign-up-forms\nPortal form deactivated : This error is thrown when the portal form is disabled. As the portal form is\ndisabled, the OTP is also not generated. This likewise means no portal user is created. However, the details\nabout the customer are sent to the CRM user as an email.\nPortal user type is deactivated : This error is thrown when the specific user type is deactivated. When a\nportal user type is disabled, all the portal forms inside that particular portal user type are also disabled. Even\nafter you enable the portal user type, the portal forms will still be disabled. The user has to manually\nactivate it again.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/portals/articles/sign-up-forms\nPortal user is deactivated : This error is thrown when the portal user is deactivated.\nLimit exceeded : This error is thrown when the portal user limit is exceeded in the CRM account.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/portals/articles/sign-up-forms\nConsider this example: Zylker Real Estates has a maximum of 500 portal users license count. In case if the\ntotal number of portal users exceeds 500, the users are not allowed inside the portal. However, the users that\nenter into the portal are potential customers, so it is important not to lose them. So, every time a customer\nsigns up to the portal after the limit is exceeded, they are stored in a different view. They are not directly\nadded into to the portal, and are listed in the Waiting for Portal Approval\u00a0view.\nTo view this, navigate to Setup > Channel > Portals > Any Portal User Type > Waiting for Portal\nAccess .\nEvery time a customer enters in to the portal access page, the CRM user gets a notification regarding the\nsame. For customers inside this Waiting for Portal Access list, the CRM user has to grant them access\nmanually.\nBefore doing that, the CRM user has to purchase additional portal user count. Zoho CRM also supports bulk\nactions, such as bulk approval, bulk rejection, and so on.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/portals/articles/sign-up-forms\nThe maximum limit count for Waiting for Portal Access is 100. After 100 customer\u00a0sign-ups are stored, any\ncustomer attempting to sign up will not be saved here. The details about those customers will be sent in an\nemail to the CRM user, and they will have to add them to the portal manually.\nEdition Limitations\nFor the trial edition, only one portal form can be created.\nPortal forms is supported in Enterprise and Ultimate editions. Five portal forms can be created per user\ntype.\nUser count for Waiting for portal access view:\nFor the trial edition, the system can hold 10 users.\nFor paid editions, the system can hold 100 users.\nIn the portal user type page, you can see the portal user count available for your account.

Consent\nshould be a deliberate action by the data subjects to opt in.\nThe consent request or form should contain details about who is collecting\u00a0the consent (data controller),\nwhere the data is processed (data processor), and where the data is being shared.\nMaintain a proper record of the consent collected. This is important in order to demonstrate that the data\nsubject has given proper consent to process data.\nAvoid usage of technical terms and legal jargons while getting consent.

There can be multiple reasons for this difference, such as legal regulations in a region, seasonal\npatterns in sales, lower cost of auditing services, and so on.\nIn many industries, there is an additional need to divvy up the fiscal year into periods that are more uniform than\ncalendar months. So, they may look at a fiscal year as 52 weeks instead of 12 months. For example, in the retail\nindustry, the contribution of weekend sales usually outstrips weekday sales. In such cases, retail businesses would\nlike to split the fiscal year into periods that include the same number of weekends. This enhances the\ncomparability of sales data (across weeks, periods, and quarters), improves forecasting, eases payroll calculation,\nand simplifies accounting work. Many retail businesses have adopted the 4-5-4 fiscal year format.\nIn Zoho CRM, you can select the fiscal year type that suits your organization:\nBy default, the standard fiscal year format is chosen and the fiscal start month is set to January.\nIf businesses want to shift the starting month, they can do so by selecting a different starting month.\nIf they want to align to other fiscal year patterns, they can choose the custom fiscal year format and pick\nfrom the available options.\nThe standard fiscal year format is where the fiscal year consists of 12 calendar months. The start of the month can\nbe chosen based on your preference.\nThe following custom fiscal year formats are available:\n4-4-5, 4-5-4, or 5-4-4: In these quarter-based formats, each quarter has 13 weeks. Within a quarter, these 13\nweeks are spread across three periods. The number of weeks in these three periods gives the names of these\nformats: 4-4-5, 4-5-4, and 5-4-4.\nA fiscal year is a period of one year that a business uses to plan, align, track, and analyze its activities,\nincluding sales.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/organization-settings/company-settings/articles/fiscal-year\n3-3-3-4, 3-3-4-3, 3-4-3-3, or 4-3-3-3: In these year-based formats, each period consists of four weeks. A\nfiscal year consists of 13 such periods. These periods are distributed across four quarters in 3-3-3-4, 3-3-4-\n3, 3-4-3-3, and 4-3-3-3 formats. The names indicate the number of periods in each of those four quarters.\nSince these formats split the year into 52 weeks (364 days), there is always a slip of a day each year. In addition,\nyou will have the slip of an extra day in a leap year. Depending on your needs, you may need to add an extra week\nto a financial period. For example, you may need to do this if you want every fiscal year to begin on the first\nMonday of April. You can add an extra week to any of the upcoming fiscal periods to correct for this.\nFor both standard and custom fiscal years, you can also select how the fiscal period will be displayed in the CRM.\nFor both, you'll be able to choose whether the display year is the starting year or the ending year. For a fiscal year\nspanning 2023 and 2024, the display year can be the starting year (2023) or the ending year (2024). Depending on\nyour choice, the third quarter may be denoted as Q3 2023 or Q3 2024.\nOnce set, the fiscal year will be used in forecasts, reports, dashboard components, and other places in the CRM.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/organization-settings/company-settings/articles/fiscal-year\nTo set up a standard fiscal year\n1.

For some, collaboration means\nconducting meetings, having discussions on phone or sending information via email while for some it is sharing data with\npeers and others in the organization.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn CRM, customer detail, notes, project requirements, deal status, primary contact's details etc. are stored in different\nmodules and managed by responsible individuals only. If the sales process requires a particular information be shared with\nother members then you must give the person necessary permissions to view, edit or refer to the record whenever\nnecessary. Zoho CRM provides different types of data sharing,\u00a0\nDirect Sharing - Individual records can be shared with other users, roles, or groups. For example, a deal can be\nshared with another sales rep, or with sales managers, or with the deal planning team to promote cross selling.\nIndirect sharing -\u00a0A record can be associated to a record and\u00a0shared along with the parent record. For example, a\ndeal can be associated with a contact and when you share the contact's record the deal too will be shared with the\nother user, roles, or groups. This type of sharing is called indirect or sharing records with their related-list.\u00a0\nRecords can be shared from any module, except:\nActivities module - Tasks, calls, and meetings are always associated to a record. So when the parent record is shared\nthe associated activities are also shared. One cannot share them separately from the Activities module.\nLinking Module - Using the multi-select lookup fields you can associate multiple look-up values to a record and\nthereby establish a perfect many-to-many module association between two modules. A linking module is one that\nserves as a junction between two modules associated with a multi-select lookup field. Records in this module cannot\nbe shared. See Also \u00a0 Linking Module\nAvailability\nPermission to Share Records\nCRM Administrators can share records with others by default.\u00a0If you want users from other profile to share records, the\nadministrators can enable the share permission for them.\u00a0\nTo enable permission to share records\n1. Click\u00a0 Setup \u00a0> Security Control\u00a0>\u00a0 Profiles .\n2. Select a profile to which you want to enable the permission.\n3.

Select the checkbox(es) for the corresponding modules to which you want to enable Share permission.\n5. Click\u00a0 Save .\nSharing Records\nThere are three\u00a0permissions that can be set for the users with whom a record is being shared: \u00a0\nRead Only - The users\u00a0can only view the shared records\nRead/Write - The users \u00a0can view and edit the records . However, they cannot change the record owner or delete the\nrecord.\nFull Access - The users can view, edit, delete and change ownership of the records .\nWhile sharing, you can specify if you want to share the record with related lists or without the related lists. When you\nshare a record, all the related lists associated to the record can have different sharing permissions. For example, when an\naccount, Zylker Widgets is shared with Read/Write permission, the associated contacts and open activities can be shared\nwith Read Only permission. Please make sure you have the Share permission enabled in your profile to share records.\nRecords can be shared with others\u00a0through:\n1. Private sharing\u00a0 \u00a0\n2. Public sharing\u00a0\nPrivate Sharing\nPublic Sharing\nRecord can be shared with individual users (max. 10\nusers),\u00a0roles (max. 5 roles), and groups (max. 5 groups)\nRecord can be shared with all users in the org.\u00a0\nEach user, role, or group can have different permission\nAll users have the same access permission\nRelated lists of a record can also be shared\nRelated list of a record cannot be shared\nA user who is a forecast manager can view their peers records even if share data with peers is disabled.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/manage-data-sharing/articles/share-records\nSending feed notification on private record sharing:\nFeed notifications can be sent to the users,\u00a0roles, and groups when records are newly shared through private access.\nTo share records\n1.

Select With Related List , if you want the the associated records to be shared as well.\n5. Select\u00a0 Notify through feeds \u00a0to send notification to the users when records are shared.\u00a0\u00a0\n6. Click Share .\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/manage-data-sharing/articles/share-records\nNotes :\nYou can share records individually.\u00a0However, you cannot share records from the module list view.\nOnly if a module's default organization permission is Private/Public Read, the record-level sharing feature\ncan be applied. Also, the user must have the\u00a0 Share permission enabled in their profiles in order to share\nrecords with other users.\nThe following associated records associated (as related list will )not be shared: closed activities, invited\nmeetings, products, campaigns, contact roles, related lists added as part of an integration.\nYou cannot share a record that has been shared with you.\nYou can share a record with those members who have permission to access a particular module irrespective\nof whether they have record-level permission or not.\u00a0\nUsers must have \"Full Access\" to a record to be able to share it with other\u00a0\nIn private access, a record can be shared with a maximum of 10 users, 5 roles, and 5 groups as direct\nsharing .\n\u00a0As indirect sharing in private access, a record can be shared with a maximum of 12 users, 5 roles, and 5\ngroups.\u00a0\nFor example, Steve shares a deal with the\u00a0pricing team (a group) and\u00a010 of his co-workers (individual users)\nattaching\u00a0quotations\u00a0as related list to solicit suggestions about the discounts.\nHere, the deal is getting shared with 10 users and a group. Along with the deal, the records in the Quotes\nmodule are also shared with those 10 users and 1 group. Now, the deal is shared as direct sharing and the\nquotes are shared as indirect sharing through the deal. If the same quotations are associated with a contact\nand if Steve would like to share the contact with 10 users and 5 groups, the contact however will be shared\nwith 10 users and 5 groups, the quotations will be shared only with 2 users and 4 groups, as the limit for\nthose quotations is already consumed.\nRecord owners and their superiors\u00a0with access to the record can share the records with other active and\nconfirmed users in the organization.\nIf the access permission of a record is changed, then feed notification will not be sent to the user. For eg., if\na record was shared with full access and later the access permission is changed to read only, then no\nnotification alert will be sent to the user intimating about the same.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/manage-data-sharing/articles/share-records\nView Shared Records\nFor easy access to the records shared by you and those shared to you, two list views are available in all the modules;\u00a0\n[Records] Shared to Me \u00a0and\u00a0 [Records] Shared by Me .\nPoints to Remember\nWhen there are different permissions to access the same record.\nProfile permission is above all \u00a0- For all the shared records, the profile permission supersedes all other\npermissions. For instance, you share a lead with Mary, giving her full access to the record but Mary's profile\npermission gives her Read Only access for the Leads module. In this case, profile permission will supersede\nthe record sharing permission and Mary will be able to only view the records.\nMultiple permissions (via different features) \u00a0- A record can be shared as per the Territory hierarchy as\nwell as through Data Sharing Rules. In this case, when multiple access permissions are provided to access\nthe same record, the highest permission in all these will be applicable.\nMultiple permissions (via different users) \u00a0- A record can be shared by different users. Let's say Mike, the\nSales Manager, shared an account without any related list items with Mary, and provided her Read/Write\npermission. Amy, a sales rep shared the same contact with Mary with related list items and gave her Full\nAccess. Here, the same record is shared by two users with two different permissions. In this case also, the\nhighest permission will be applicable and Mary will have full access to the contact.\nWhen there are multiple sharing for the same record.\nWhere a record is shared by different users - One record can be shared with a person by different users.\nSay, Contact B has four deals associated with it. One of which is a Big Deal and is accessible only to John,\nthe Sales Manager. Other three deals are accessible by Mary too, the Sales Rep. If Mary shares Contact B\nwith Mike, he will be able to access the contact and only the three deals associated to it that are accessible\nto Mary.\nWhere a record is shared by different ways - One record can be shared directly and the same can be\nshared via related list sharing. For example, Deal B can be shared directly with John. The same deal is\nassociated with Contact B and another user shares it with John, indirectly sharing Deal B in its related list.\nThat way the record is shared with the same user twice. If one revokes sharing, John will still be able to\naccess the record. This is taken into consideration as a record can be shared with a maximum of 10 users.\nThrough related lists, a record can be shared with a maximum of 12 users.\nSimilarly, a Deal A is shared as public with all users with read access. The same Deal A is shared by Amy\nwith John through indirect sharing via Contact A with read/write access. Now, since Deal A has different\naccess levels, the higher permission is taken into consideration. i.e, John will have access to Deal A with\nread/write permission. If the public access to the record is revoked, John will still be able to read/write Deal\nA.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/manage-data-sharing/articles/share-records\nThe shared records have a Timeline view, where you can see the log of the shared details: when the record was shared,\nwith whom, what permissions were given, etc.\u00a0\nYou can check who shared a record with you.\u00a0Records shared via Private access are denoted by a person icon.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/manage-data-sharing/articles/share-records\nRecords shared via Public access are denoted by a globe icon.\u00a0\nManage Sharing\nAfter sharing a record, you can always manage sharing by:\nsharing the record with more members.\nrevoking sharing for individual users, roles, or groups.\nchanging the sharing permissions for members.\nchanging the record access type: private to public and vice versa.\nviewing the sharing summary.\u00a0\nTo manage sharing\n1. Go to the\u00a0 Module\u00a0 from which you want to manage sharing.\n2. In the\u00a0 Record Details\u00a0 page, click the\u00a0 More Actions\u00a0 icon and then click\u00a0 Share .\n3. In the \u00a0Sharing [Records]\u00a0 popup, click\u00a0 Manage Sharing .\nSelect the members with whom you want to share the record and choose the access permission as required.\u00a0\nMove your mouse pointer to the users with whom the record is already shared and click the\u00a0 Remove\u00a0 icon to\nremove sharing.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/manage-data-sharing/articles/share-records\nClick the\u00a0 View Summary \u00a0link.\nThis provides a detailed log of the record sharing.\n4. Click\u00a0 Done .\nRevoke Sharing\nIf you have shared a record to members there is also an option to revoke complete sharing. On revoking, the record will no\nlonger be accesible to those users but let's take this case: Mike has shared Deal A with Amy and John has shared Contact A\nalong with its related lists with Amy. Contact A has Deal A associated to it. So when Mike revokes sharing, it will still be\nshared with Amy as it is indirectly shared by John along with its parent record (contact).\nTo revoke sharing\n1. Go to the\u00a0 Module\u00a0 from which you want to revoke sharing for a record and select the record.\n2. In the\u00a0 Record Details\u00a0 page, click the\u00a0 More Actions\u00a0 icon and then click\u00a0 Share .\n3. In the Sharing [Records] \u00a0popup, click\u00a0 Revoke Sharing .\n4.

This is especially useful for organizations that maintain different\nCRM accounts to manage their business, such as a franchisee or a subsidiary.\nFor example, imagine a software company has two different business units under one company portfolio, each one has a separate customer base, marketing strategy, and\nrevenue generation plans. Thus the company maintains two CRM accounts to manage sales and customer information. The CEO and management often have to log in to\nboth accounts to understand business growth and derive insights which are used to prepare reports, agendas, and ideas for future planning. It can be difficult to remember\ndifferent login credentials and broadcasting important data directly from the CRM accounts in a board meeting can become challenging.\nTo improve multiple account accessibility, Zoho CRM allows users to configure multiple orgs and manage them from one account with a common login credential. They\ncan easily swap between the accounts whenever required. There are two ways a CRM user can be part of multiple org accounts:\nBy creating org accounts\nBy accepting invitations from other org accounts\nCreating multiple CRM organizations\nCRM super admins and administrators both have the privilege to create multiple org accounts. This will allow them to log in to multiple accounts using a common login\ncredential. Non-admin users can be invited to join these org accounts. They can accept the invitation and be part of multiple org accounts.\nThere are some key points that you must note before creating multiple org accounts:\nCRM edition of the new org\u00a0\nThe new organization account that is created will always be set to the Enterprise trial edition by default. The administrator must upgrade to the required subscription before\nthe trial ends. A user can be part of orgs that are in different editions.\nUser licenses for the CRM orgs\nThe user licenses must be purchased separately for each account. Read more about purchasing users' licenses.\nAccess URLs of the org accounts\nEach account has a unique access URL which can be changed either at the time of account creation or later. The access URL can be changed only by the super admin of the\norg from the Company Settings page in the CRM account.\nPlease note that this feature does NOT provide any kind of data sync between the accounts. The sole purpose of creating multiple accounts is to provide users with\nease of access to the different CRM organization accounts.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/organization-settings/multiple-organizations/articles/managing-multiple-crm-organizations\nPrivilege to create org accounts\nTo create multiple org accounts, a user must be an admin or super admin in one of the CRM accounts. For example, if John is a standard profile user for Zylker Products\nand an admin for Zylker Services, he will be allowed to create accounts. However, if he has a standard profile in both the orgs, he will be restricted from creating a new\naccount.\nNumber of accounts\nAny user can be part of 10 accounts at a given point. These accounts can be in different editions (Standard, Professional, Enterprise, Ultimate, CRM Plus, or Zoho\nOne).\nA user can only create ONE CRM Plus account and can be part of up to nine other CRM Plus accounts through invitations received from other CRM Plus orgs.\u00a0\nA user can be part of only ONE Zoho One account and be part of other Zoho One accounts as an external user. Read more about external users.\nTo create multiple organizations\n1. Log in to your CRM account with administrative privileges.\n2. Click the profile icon in the top-right corner.\n3. In the profile pop-up, click the arrow next to the company name and click Manage.\n4. In the Organization Listing page, click Create New Organization.\n5.

Click Create Organization.\nYou will be redirected to the CRM account of the new organization.\nSending invitations to users from different organization accounts\nCRM users who are already part of a CRM account can be added and invited to multiple org accounts. They will be able to accept the invitation from another account\nwithout having to disassociate from your existing account. Read more about adding and inviting users.\nAccepting or declining invitations\nThe user can accept or decline the org invitation within 7 days from the following places:\nEmail: The email invitation that is sent by the host will have the option to accept or\u00a0decline the invitation. If the user is part of other org accounts, those account\nnames will be listed in the email.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/organization-settings/multiple-organizations/articles/managing-multiple-crm-organizations\nOrganization listing: The user can go to the profile icon and click Manage.

In your CRM, click the Profile icon.\n2. Click the drop-down arrow next to the org name.\n3. Select and click on an org of your choice.\u00a0\nSetting an org account as default\nInvitations sent from CRM Plus and Zoho One accounts or any CRM account that has Cliq integration or IP restriction enabled will NOT be listed in the\nOrganization Listings. Invited users can accept the invitations for these types of accounts ONLY from the invitation email they receive.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/organization-settings/multiple-organizations/articles/managing-multiple-crm-organizations\nThe organization account from which the first account is created is considered the default org account. However, a user can set any account as the default org account.\nSetting a default account allows the user to land into that account whenever they log in to Zoho CRM.\nThe user can also enter an organization's access URL to directly log in to that particular organization.\nTo set an account as default\n1. Go to the Organization Listing.\n2. Hover over the desired org account and click Set as Default.\nDissociating users from their default org account\nIn case a user is disassociated from an account that is set as default by them or the default account is deleted by the admin or super admin, then upon next login, they can\nset another account as default from the organization listing.\nMultiple org accounts and integration\nIf you are using other Zoho products or any third-party applications that you want to integrate with Zoho CRM, you will be prompted to choose one of the org accounts\nduring integration.

Below are some commonly asked\nquestions regarding email bounces and how to resolve them.\u00a0\nWhat are email bounces?\nEmail bounces occur when an email sent to a recipient cannot be delivered. There are two main types of bounces:\nhard bounces and soft bounces. A hard bounce, for example, may occur when the email address is invalid, the\ndomain does not exist, etc. A soft bounce on the other hand occurs for reasons such as the recipient's mailbox is\nfull, the server is down, or the email is too large.\nWhat is a bounce warning?\u00a0\u00a0\nA bounce warning is a notification that one or more of your emails have been rejected by the recipient's email\nserver. This can occur due to reasons such as an incorrect email address, a full mailbox, or a blocked domain. In\nZoho CRM, a bounce warning signifies that an email sent to a recipient's mailbox has not been delivered\nsuccessfully yet, but it has not been classified as bounced either.\nTypically, this indicates a temporary issue, and the server will continue attempting to deliver the email before it is\nmarked as bounced.\nWhat are the common reasons for email bounces?\u00a0\nCommon reasons for email bounces include:\u00a0\u00a0\nInvalid email address\u00a0\u00a0\nFull mailbox\u00a0\u00a0\nBlocked domain\u00a0\u00a0\nEmail server down\u00a0\u00a0\nEmail too large\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-capabilities/articles/faqs-on-email-bounces\nWhat happens when an email address is marked as a soft bounce?\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen an email cannot be delivered to a recipient's email address temporarily, it is considered a soft bounce by the\nrecipient's email servers. In these cases, you will have the opportunity to resend the email to the soft-bounced\naddresses. However, if an email address continues to be marked as a soft bounce multiple times, it will be blocked\ntemporarily in Zoho CRM, citing the bounce issue.\nWhat happens when an email address is marked as a hard bounce?\u00a0\u00a0\nWhen an email address is marked as a hard bounce, it means that emails are permanently undeliverable to that\naddress. These hard-bounced email addresses will be blocked, meaning you will not be able to send any emails to\nthem from Zoho CRM again.\nHow does Zoho CRM classify email bounces?\u00a0\nZoho CRM classifies email bounces into two categories: Temporary and Permanent. Temporary bounces include\nsoft bounces and certain types of hard bounces that can be rectified by the sender.\nPermanent bounces occur when the recipient\u2019s email servers flag a hard bounce, resulting in the email address\nbeing permanently blocked from Zoho CRM.\nWhat is a temporary bounce in Zoho CRM?\u00a0\nA temporary bounce in Zoho CRM includes soft bounces and certain types of hard bounces that can be rectified\nby the sender. Zoho CRM provides an 'Unblock' option for email addresses that are temporarily blocked.\nHowever, hard bounces are usually permanent and cannot be unblocked within CRM, but there are instances\nwhere a hard bounce will be treated as a temporary bounce by Zoho CRM, allowing users to unblock the email\naddresses.\nWhat is a permanent bounce in Zoho CRM?\u00a0\u00a0\nA permanent bounce in Zoho CRM occurs when the recipient\u2019s email servers flag a hard bounce. This results in\nthe email address being permanently blocked from Zoho CRM for all future email sending and an unblock option\ncannot be provided.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-capabilities/articles/faqs-on-email-bounces\nCan a hard bounce be treated as a temporary bounce in Zoho CRM?\u00a0\nYes, there are instances where a hard bounce will be treated as a temporary bounce by Zoho CRM, allowing users\nto unblock the email addresses. This happens when Zoho CRM\u2019s email servers repeatedly try to send an email\nwhen a soft bounce occurs, and failure to deliver the email even after these repeated attempts will then be\nclassified as a hard bounce but treated as a temporary bounce by Zoho CRM.\nWhat action should be taken on receiving a bounce warning in Zoho\nCRM?\u00a0\nA bounce warning in Zoho CRM indicates a temporary issue with email delivery, and the server will keep trying\nto deliver the email before it is marked as bounced. The sender may need to monitor the situation closely. If the\nemail is not delivered even after multiple attempts, it may be classified as a temporary or permanent bounce by\nZoho CRM, and appropriate actions, such as using the 'Unblock' option or permanently blocking the email\naddress, will be taken based on the classification.\nHow can I unblock temporarily blocked email addresses?\u00a0\u00a0\nIf an email address is bounced for temporary reasons, you will have provisions to unblock it from within Zoho\nCRM. Learn more.\nHow can I reduce my bounce rate?\u00a0\nTo reduce your bounce rate, follow these best practices:\u00a0\u00a0\nRegularly update your contact list\u00a0\u00a0\nAvoid sending emails to old and stale email lists\u00a0\u00a0\nUse a valid \"From\" address from a reputable domain\u00a0\u00a0\nAvoid buying email addresses from illegitimate sources\u00a0\u00a0\nWhat are the best practices to avoid email bounces?\u00a0\nAvoid formatting issues while importing a list into Zoho CRM.\nAvoid sending emails to old and stale email lists.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-capabilities/articles/faqs-on-email-bounces\nUse a valid \"From\" address from a reputable domain.\nDo not buy email addresses from illegitimate sources.\nRemove invalid email addresses.\nHow can I avoid formatting issues while importing a list into Zoho\nCRM?\u00a0\u00a0\nTo avoid formatting issues while importing a list into Zoho CRM, make sure your list is properly formatted and\ndoes not contain any invalid characters or fields.\nWhy should I avoid sending emails to old and stale email lists?\u00a0\u00a0\nOld and stale email lists may contain invalid email addresses or addresses that are no longer in use. Sending\nemails to these addresses can lead to a high bounce rate.\nWhy is it important to use a valid \"From\" address from a reputable\ndomain?\u00a0\nUsing a valid \"From\" address from a reputable domain increases the likelihood that your emails will be delivered\nsuccessfully and not marked as spam.\nWhy should I avoid buying email addresses from illegitimate sources?\u00a0\nBuying email addresses from illegitimate sources can lead to a high bounce rate, as these lists may contain invalid\nor fake email addresses. Additionally, sending emails to addresses that have not opted in to receive\ncommunications from you can result in your emails being marked as spam.\nWhat steps should I take if I receive a bounce warning?\u00a0\u00a0\nIf you receive a bounce warning, it is important to understand the cause of the bounce and take steps to prevent it\nfrom happening again. This may include updating your contact list to remove invalid email addresses, ensuring\nthat your emails are not being marked as spam, and following the best practices to avoid email bounces.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-capabilities/articles/faqs-on-email-bounces\nHow can I ensure that my emails are not marked as spam?\u00a0\nTo ensure that your emails are not marked as spam, follow these best practices:\u00a0\u00a0\nUse a valid \"From\" address from a reputable domain\u00a0\u00a0\nAvoid using spam words or phrases in your email subject and content\u00a0\u00a0\nDo not send emails to recipients who have not opted in to receive communications from you\u00a0\u00a0\nInclude a clear and easy-to-find unsubscribe link in your emails\nWhat should I do if my emails are being marked as spam?\u00a0\u00a0\nIf your emails are being marked as spam, it is important to review your email content and practices to ensure that\nyou are following the best practices for email sending.

You can do this easily using\nthe\u00a0Account Lookup\u00a0field in CRM.\nIf there are multiple contacts associated with one account, you can still achieve this association by simply\nselecting the same account for all the contacts, thereby establishing a one-to-many relationship.\nHowever, in all these cases, note that you can select only one value using a look-up field.\nNow imagine a scenario in which you have one of these contacts working on a contract basis for two accounts. So\nyou have a situation in which you need to associate two companies to the same contact. The\u00a0Account Look-\nup\u00a0field allows the selection of only one value.

They have two modules in their CRM\n-\u00a0Listings\u00a0and\u00a0Prospects.\nJack Smith, one of the prospects, is interested in looking at 3 listings (C-807, B-196 & H-786).\nApart from Jack, 3 other prospects - Jane, Jill and Derek - are all interested in looking at C-807.\nThis means, when the record Jack Smith is created, 3 values need to be chosen for the listings he is interested in.\nAlso, the listing C-807 should have 4 prospects associated with it. So there is a need to choose many values from\na lookup field. A regular lookup field lets you choose only one value.\nSolution:\nIn this case, Zylker Real Estates could create a multi-select lookup field. Let us see how.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-modules/articles/linking-modules\nHow to create a multi-select lookup field\nTo create a multi-select lookup field\n1. Go to\u00a0Setup > Customization > Modules and Fields.\n2. Click the required module, in this case,\u00a0Prospects.\n3. From the list of fields available, drag and drop the\u00a0Multi-select lookup field.\nNote that you can create a maximum of 2\u00a0Multi-select lookup fields\u00a0per module.\n4. In the\u00a0Multi-Select Lookup Properties\u00a0window, enter the details as seen in the following image.\nTo create self-referencing lookup field, select the same module as the Related module, that is, Prospects.\nRead more.\n5. Select the\u00a0Allow creating relationship-specific modules\u00a0checkbox if a\u00a0Linking Module\u00a0is required and\nenter its name.\n6. Click\u00a0Done.\n7. Save the layout.\nThe multi-select lookup field is now created. When Zylker Real Estates now creates a record called Jack\nSmith, they will now be able to choose more than one value from the multi-select lookup field.\nThe values thus chosen will be associated to each record as related lists.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-modules/articles/linking-modules\nLinking Module - An Overview\nNote\nIf you do not see a module displayed in the\u00a0Select Related Module\u00a0list inside the\u00a0Multi-Select\nLookup Properties window, it is likely that this module has reached its maximum limit for\u00a0Multi-\nSelect Lookup\u00a0fields.\nYou can create a maximum of two\u00a0Multi-Select Lookup\u00a0fields per module.\nIf you have more than one layout in the\u00a0Related Module, you will be prompted to select the layout\nin which the\u00a0Multi-Select Lookup\u00a0field must be added.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-modules/articles/linking-modules\nWhat is a Linking Module?\nA linking module is one that serves as a junction between two modules associated with a multi-select lookup field.\nConsider the example above - that of Zylker Real Estates. The prospect Jack Smith has now been created with 3\nassociated listings via a multiselect lookup field. But let's say he requests a negotiation for each listing- and the\nnegotiated rent differs for all 3 listings. Now where can this field be stored?\nIt cannot be a field in the Jack's record, as there are 3 different prices based on each house.\nIt cannot be a field in the listing's record either, as other prospects apart from Jack may have offered different\nnegotiations for it.\nIn order to manage this diversity, Zoho CRM allows you to create something called a\u00a0Linking Module. Each\nassociation between two modules (created via a multi-select lookup field) is created as a record in the linking\nmodule. So, when 3 listings are associated with Jack, 3 separate records are created in the Linking Module - this\nlets you create separate Negotiated Rent in each record.\nTo enable creation of a Linking Module, simply select the\u00a0Allow creating relationship-specific\nmodules\u00a0checkbox and enter a name for the linking module. You can create custom fields and manage the linking\nmodule like you would any custom module.\nWorking with a linking module\nOnce you have created a linking module, you can customize it, create records and generate reports for the module.\nClick on the links below to read in detail about a linking module.\nWorking with the related lists of a linking module\nNote\nThe multi-select look up field can currently be used while individually creating a record. It is not\nsupported for records generated via import.\nCustom views cannot be created for multi-select lookup field type, as there are multiple values.\nHowever you may create custom views in the linking module.\nAutomation processes like Blueprint, Workflow rules, and approval process are supported for\nrecords in the Linking Module.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-modules/articles/linking-modules\nCustomizing a linking module\nCreating reports and dashboards\nDeleting a linking module\nProperties of a linking module\nWorking with the related lists of the linking module\nFollowing are points to note when you link two primary modules via a multi-select lookup field.\nEach primary module will contain the other module's related list in the respective\u00a0Record Details\u00a0page.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-modules/articles/linking-modules\nThis related list will also display details of the\u00a0Linking Module, if you have chosen to create one.\nYou can customize the related list columns to display the details you wish to see.\nYou can also rename the\u00a0Related List\u00a0as you see fit.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-modules/articles/linking-modules\nYou can edit a linking module's record by clicking on the\u00a0Edit\u00a0icon against each record.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-modules/articles/linking-modules\nIf you click on the hyperlink of a record and not the\u00a0Edit\u00a0icon, you will be taken to the respective record's\nDetail page and not necessarily the linking module.\nYou can assign new records to the related list or edit the existing record association directly from this related\nlist. Simply click the\u00a0Assign\u00a0or\u00a0Edit\u00a0links above the related list to do the same.\nTo dissociate a record from the related list, simple click the\u00a0Cross\u00a0icon against the record.\nTo access, view and customize the related list, one must have suitable\u00a0permissions for the related\u00a0Multi-select\nlookup field.\nRecords from the\u00a0Linking Module\u00a0will have no other related lists except\u00a0Notes.\nCustomizing a linking module\nA linking module can be customized just like any other custom module. You can add new fields and sections, edit\nfield properties and set module/field permissions.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-modules/articles/linking-modules\nFor instance, the\u00a0Prospects Vs Listings\u00a0module captures the\u00a0Negotiated Rent\u00a0and\u00a0Negotiated Advance\u00a0for each\nassociation created via the multi-select lookup field.\nFollowing are points to note regarding customization of a linking module.\nModule Organization:\nThe\u00a0Organize Modules\u00a0option under module customization allows you to decide the order in which the\nmodule tabs appear on the menu bar. You can also hide a module by removing it from the list of\u00a0Selected\nTabs.\nNow in case you decide to hide a module that participates in a linking module, this linking module will also\nbe removed from the list of\u00a0Selected Tabs.\u00a0\nThis is because the linking module is dependant on the primary modules and cannot be active even if one of\nthe primary modules is removed.\nSimilarly when you add a primary module back to the list of Selected Tabs, the linking module will also be\nadded back along with it.\nMandatory Fields:\nThe primary module based fields in the Linking Module will be marked as mandatory by default. As the\nentire linking module runs on these two primary modules, you cannot make them non-mandatory.\nCustom fields limits:\nCurrently, a linking module can accommodate a maximum of 100 fields in a linking module. This includes\nthe system-defined fields as well as custom fields.\nCreating reports and dashboards\nYou can create specific reports and dashboards based on the records in a linking module.\nIn the above example of a Many-to-many module association between the\u00a0Prospects Vs Listings\u00a0module, let's say\nyou wish to see the listings with a\u00a0Negotiated Rent\u00a0value of more than Rs.10000. You can create a simple\nsummary report with the\u00a0Prospects Vs Listings\u00a0module.\nIn another scenario, say you wish to see a report where you can see the negotiated rent of each prospect, in the\nexact month of their tentative moving date.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-modules/articles/linking-modules\nFor this you need to select the\u00a0Prospects\u00a0module as the primary module while creating a matrix report and choose\nthe\u00a0Prospects Vs Listings\u00a0module in the\u00a0Related Modules. Note that if you choose the\u00a0Linking Module, the other\nprimary module also gets selected along with it by default and vice versa.\nOnce you have generated the report, you can see each prospect's negotiated rent grouped as per their tentative\nmoving date.\nYou can also create dashboards out of these reports.\u00a0See also:\u00a0Reports and Dashboards.\nDeleting a linking module\nYou cannot directly delete a linking module in CRM. Also, as long as the linking module exists you cannot delete\nthe primary modules either, as they are needed for the linking module to function.\nTo delete a linking module, you must remove the multi-select lookup field that has created the Many-to-many\nmodule association between two modules in the first place. When you do this, the linking module will\nautomatically be removed.\nMake sure to remove this field from any other layouts or the list of Unused fields in order to completely delete it.\nNote\nThe linking module gets displayed in the list of related modules when you create a report based on\none of its dependant modules.\nIf you choose the linking module as a related module, the other primary module involved in the\nMany-to-many module association also gets selected by default. In such a case you cannot select\nother modules to create a report.\nIf you create a report based on a linking module, the\u00a0Related Modules\u00a0list will only contain its\nprimary modules.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-modules/articles/linking-modules\nOnce you have removed the linking module, you are free to delete the primary modules as there is no longer a\ndependency between the modules.\nProperties of a linking module\nThe Multi-select lookup field will be created for the current layout for the module in question. If you have\nmultiple page layouts for a module, you will be prompted to choose the layout(s) in which the field has to be\ncreated in the\u00a0Related Module.\nIf you remove a multi-select lookup field from a layout, it is still present in the\u00a0Unused Fields\u00a0section. If you\nwish to permanently delete a multi-select lookup field, you must delete it from all layouts (if any) and also\nfrom the list of unused fields. Note that this is a permanent action and cannot be undone. When you delete a\nmulti-select lookup field, the linking module is also removed along with it.\nIf you delete a record whose multi-select lookup field has created many associations with another module,\nthose records in the linking module are deleted along with it and sent to the\u00a0Recycle Bin. When you restore\nthe main record, it is again restored with all the associations again.\nExport of records is not supported for a linking module as well as the Multi-select lookup field in a module.\n", "source": "linking-modules.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "enterprise-vs-free-downgrade", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/manage-subscriptions/articles/enterprise-vs-free-downgrade\nZoho Corporation\nFeatures you will miss on downgrading from\nEnterprise to Free edition\n\u00a0\nSalesforce Automation\nSales Forecasting\nForecast Based on Territories\nMacros\nSalesSignals\nAssignment Rules\nCalendar Booking\nPortals\nMultiple Currencies\nWebhooks\nWorkflow Usage and Reports\nSocial Profiles\nScoring Rules\nMultiple Scoring Rules\nMotivator for Zoho CRM\nBefore you downgrade:\u00a0If you're considering downgrading from Zoho CRM Enterprise to the Free\nedition, you will be losing access to\u00a0100+\u00a0valuable features.

In the\nsection below we have listed out few benefits of personalizing the setup page:\nAdd additional applications in the setup page\u00a0\nSometimes organizations need to use applications other than CRM in their daily business activities. For\ninstance, a wealth management company may need the money control app to keep tab on stock market\nvalues, an aviation industry may require apps for weather briefings or navigation details. A digital\ncommunication company can use an app for live chat with its clients. In such cases, it can be challenging to\ntoggle between several windows continuously, also it increases the chances of entering erroneous data in\nCRM during data transfer processes. To avoid such situations, it is advisable to create a single platform that\ncan give better and organized accessibility. You can customize the setup page by adding these applications to\nit.\nRename the features as per your business vertical\u00a0\nDepending on the type of industry you belong to, you may refer a particular feature by different names. Like,\ninstead of channels you probably use communications or you may prefer personalize to customization. In\nsuch cases, your teams will relate better to the CRM system if familiar terms are used to represent the\nfeatures. You can simply rename the standard features to your preference.\nReorder the features based on frequency of usage\nLet's consider that your clients mainly interact with the sales reps through two channels: social media and\nportals. In such cases, it would be sensible to place these features on top of the list and move the less\nfrequently used features to the end. Hence, you can easily reorder the features and position them in the menu\nfor better visibility. Likewise, you can also reposition the main menus like Data Administration, Marketplace\nor Channels based on your priority and frequency of access.\nReposition the groups in the setup page\u00a0\nThe main groups like automation, data administrations or marketplace can be repositioned based on your\npreference by simply dragging and dropping them to preferred places in the setup page.\nHide features and menu as per organization's requirement\u00a0\nThere are chances that you may not be using all the CRM features for your business, so instead of cluttering\nyour setup page with string of features that are unused you can simply hide them from the display.\nAvailability\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-setup-page/articles/customizing-setup-page\nCustomize the Setup Page\nIn the setup page the features are grouped under different categories called groups, menu and submenu; the image\nbelow demonstrates the same.\nCustomizing the CRM setup page consists of the following four steps:\nStep 1. Add groups in the setup page\nThe groups represent the category under which you classify the CRM features. For example, in the standard setup\nthe groups are - Channels, Users and Controls, Automation etc. You can add a new group based on your business\nrequirement.\nStep 2. Add menu and submenu in each group\nPermission Required\nUsers with Module Customization permission in their profile can access this feature.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-setup-page/articles/customizing-setup-page\nEach application that you add is called a submenu and all these submenus are collectively called a menu. For\nexample, in the standard setup under Channels group Social is a menu that hosts several features like Twitter,\nFacebook and Google+ which are the submenu. As per your requirement you can add a menu and submenu to the\ngroups in the setup page.\nStep 3. Add action to the submenu\nAdding an action requires you to link the application that you added in the submenu to a widget. You can either\nlink the submenu to an existing widget or create a new widget and link it.\nStep 4. Choose permission for the submenu\nIn the next step, you will have to choose an appropriate permission for the submenu features from the list of\npermission. Depending on the type of action these features perform you can choose the permission from the list of\noptions. Below are the permissions that you can choose:\nModule customization\nManage automation\nZoho CRM API access\nUser management\nMigrate data from other CRM\nSocial Admin\nPersonal Social Profiles\nStep 5. Toggle on/off the submenu visibility\nYou can toggle off the visibility of any feature as and when required. If you want to restrict access to a feature\ntemporarily you can simply toggle off the visibility until it's required again. The feature that's visibility is turned\noff will appear greyed out in the setup page.\nTo customize the CRM Setup page\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-setup-page/articles/customizing-setup-page\n1.

While many organizations use a standard email template for consistency,\nthere are instances where a personalized approach is required to meet specific professional standards.\nIn Zoho CRM, the Email Compose Settings empower users to tailor emails sent to leads, contacts, deals, and\nmore, directly from the respective modules. By default, emails from these modules adopt a system-defined style,\nincluding font and color, which lacks customization options. However, with the Compose Settings, users can\ncustomize these aspects to align with their business identity. This includes setting preferred fonts, colors, and even\nthe default 'from' address, ensuring that each email not only meets unique business needs, but also maintains\nconsistency and professionalism across all communications.\nConfiguring Compose Settings\nThe Compose Settings enable CRM users to tailor the default email interface according to their preferences. These\nsettings are accessible to all CRM users, allowing for individual customization.\nIn Compose Settings, you can customize the:\u00a0\nFont type\nFont size\nDefault From Address\nEmail signatures\u00a0\nFont type and size:\u00a0Users can select a font from the provided list under Default Font Family and the font\nsize from Default Font Size list, which will then be set as the default for all emails sent from the CRM using\nthe \"Send Email\" option.\nUsers can also add up to five custom font styles to match the unique requirements of their business.\nWhile setting the default font size, users can also define up to five custom font sizes that can be used to fine\nNote: This is a built-in functionality of Zoho CRM available in all editions.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/user\n-functions/articles/configuring-email-compose-setting\ntune the way the content needs to look in the email that is sent out.\nDefault from Address:\u00a0Email addresses added under organization emails or configured via IMAP or POP3\nintegration will appear in the list of default \"from\" addresses. Users can select one of these addresses as\ntheir default \"from\" address. This address will then be displayed automatically when composing emails to\nyour customers.\nDefault reply-to address: The users can now specify the default reply-to address inside the email compose\nsettings. This is useful when the email is sent out from an organization mail address that is not integrated\nwith the CRM, or from a 'no-reply' mail address. Having a default reply-to would ensure that replies can be\ntracked inside Zoho CRM if the reply-to mailbox is connected with Zoho CRM.\nRead more about Organization emails.\nEmail signatures: Email addresses from organization emails, the user's personal email, and those set up\nthrough IMAP or POP3 integration will be presented as options for setting up email signatures. Users can\ncreate up to five email signatures, and each signature can be applied to multiple email addresses.\nFor example, sales@zylker-eu.com and sales@zylker.com can both have a common email signature:\nBest Compliments from Zylker Family,\nContact us at: +71888999900\nPS: You are receiving this email because your email address is registered with us. To stop these further\ncorrespondence email us at:\u00a0noemails@zylkerservices.com\nNote: While configuring the compose settings, users can view only those org email addresses that have\nbeen shared with them. For example, if sales@zylker.com is not shared with marketing admins profile,\nthen this email address will not be displayed for users in that role while configuring the default address.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/user\n-functions/articles/configuring-email-compose-setting\nWhile composing an email the associated signature will be auto-populated.\nTo configure compose settings:\n1.

Select the Default Font Size from the drop-down list.\nCheck Preview before finalizing the font type and size.\n5.

You can ensure the\ninterface presented to a user is relevant to that user's work and dynamically styled based on the data present in a\nrecord. This goes a long way in increasing adoption and usage as the users have an interface that is easy to learn\nand more usable than the standard design available in the CRM.\nYour organization cannot unlock these benefits immediately after redesigning the interfaces. The changes have to\nbe carefully validated and tested in realistic conditions to ensure they assist users instead of being superficial\nchanges that get in their way.\nIn Zoho CRM, you can test your Canvas pages in the sandbox environment before deploying them in the\nproduction environment. By testing the interface before rolling it out to all end users, you can iron out the kinks\nand issues in a safe environment with a smaller set of users. This ensures a smooth transition from one interface to\nthe next for your users.\nTo learn more about Canvas, see:\nCustomizing Record Detail page using Canvas\nCustomizing List Views using Canvas\nTo learn more about sandbox, see:\nSandbox overview.\nScenario\nIn a manufacturing company located in a bustling city, a CRM administrator noticed that she was receiving a lot\nof complaints about usability. Speaking with users across different teams, she realized many of them were finding\nit hard to quickly get the information required to do their jobs.\nAs the company was becoming more data-driven, they were collecting a lot of data which was stored in different\nmodules. However, the data-intensive record detail page was hard to navigate for all teams. The admin\ncollaborated with a small group of users from different teams to design and test new interfaces.\nUsers from the sales, marketing, customer service, finance, and legal teams shared their needs and challenges with\nthe admin. Listening attentively, the admin used Canvas to craft customized list view and record detail pages to\nmeet their requirements. Using the sandbox feature, the user group tested the interfaces, evaluating usability and\nefficiency. Their valuable feedback guided the admin in refining the designs.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/data-administration/sandbox/articles/canvas-in-sandbox\nAfter several iterations, the admin and the user group felt confident in the interfaces' effectiveness. Seamlessly\ndeploying the redesigned pages from the sandbox into the live environment, they were able to improve the usage\nof the CRM across teams and were soon getting requests for further changes to the different pages.\nAvailability\nTo make Canvas-related changes in sandbox\nWhen you are creating a sandbox:\n1.

Users at a higher hierarchy can always\naccess all the records of at a lower hierarchy. For example, a Sales Manager can access all the Sales Reps' records\nwhereas Sales Reps can access only their records.\u00a0\nKey points to understanding roles\nUsers with a\u00a0 CEO role\u00a0 have access to the entire database within your organization.\nManagers in the role hierarchy cannot view or edit their subordinates' records if they do not have the \"Read\"\nor \"Edit\" permissions for the type of record.\nUsers at a higher role can access other users\u2019 data below their hierarchy.

Consider the following examples.\nIn a real estate company, the particulars required from a customer may be different depending on whether\nhe/she wishes to buy an apartment or villa.\nIn an educational institution, the particulars required from a student may be different depending on whether\nhe has chosen Physics or Economics.\nIn an insurance company, the particulars required for a motor insurance policy may be different depending on\nthe vehicle type - private car or a commercial vehicle.\nSo, the value you enter for one field will decide the necessity for a bunch of other fields. When you are filling the\ndetails for a Car Insurance Policy, the Commercial vehicle-related fields are not even required - but they are still\non your layout. You may be looking at 10 fields when you need only 5.\nHowever, you cannot do away with the remaining 5 fields in the layout - as they are required when Commercial\nVehicle is chosen. This is where conditional layouts enter the picture. Conditional layouts are created with layout\nrules, by which you can establish an interface in which certain fields are shown depending on the value entered in\na previous field.\nAs a result you are able to make your layouts dynamic - as the entire structure of a layout changes based on field\nvalues you enter. Note that you are not eliminating fields from the layout, you are only controlling how a layout\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-conditional-layouts\nappears based on certain field values.\nManage dependent fields efficiently | Conditional Layouts\nManage dependent fields efficiently | Conditional Layouts\nAvailability\nUsing Layout Rules (conditional layout)\nLet's look at how to create a conditional layout with the help of a scenario.\nZylker Insurance offers motor insurance products such as car insurance and commercial vehicle insurance.\nIn this case, if Zylker includes all these details in a single form/layout, there is a slight difficulty. That is, when a\ncustomer needs a policy for a car, the form unnecessarily asks for details regarding commercial vehicles as well.\nObserve the details in the table below:\nField\nPrivate Car\nCommercial Vehicle\nPurpose for which vehicle will be\nused\n\u2718\n\u2714\nNature of goods normally carried\n\u2718\n\u2714\nPermission Required\nUsers with the Customize Zoho CRM profile permission can access this feature.\nCheck Feature Availability and Limits\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-conditional-layouts\nType of Permit (Goods Carrying\nVehicle)\n\u2718\n\u2714\nType of Permit (Passenger\nCarrying Vehicles)\n\u2718\n\u2714\nHazardous Substances Description\n\u2718\n\u2714\nThe above table lists fields that are required for a commercial vehicle but not a private car. This means an entire\nsection in a form becomes unnecessary the moment you choose \"Private Car\".\nThis only causes clutter in your form and delays the process of creating a record.\nThis is where conditional layouts enter the picture.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-conditional-layouts\nIn the above example, using layout rules, you can achieve a dynamic setup in which only when \" Commercial\nVehicle \" is chosen, the Commercial Vehicle details appear - in other cases it remains hidden. This way, you can\noptimize your forms.\nCreate layout rules\nTo create layout rules\n1. Go to\u00a0 Setup > Customization > Modules and Fields .\n2. From the list of modules, select the required module.\nIn this scenario, select\u00a0 Leads .\n3. Select the required layout. Example,\u00a0 Motor Insurance layout.\n4. Go to the\u00a0 Layout Rules \u00a0section.\n5. Click \u00a0New Layout Rule.\n6. In the\u00a0 New Layout Rule\u00a0 popup, enter the following details:\nEnter a\u00a0 name \u00a0for the rule.\nDescribe \u00a0the rule.\nChoose the layout \u00a0for which this rule is applicable. Example, Motor Insurance\nChoose a primary field \u00a0that controls this rule. Example, Type of Vehicle\nChoose a condition \u00a0to initiate the rule. Example, Type of Vehicle is Commercial Vehicle.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-conditional-layouts\nClick\u00a0 Next\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-conditional-layouts\n7. In the Rule page, the Condition specified is prepopulated. So click\u00a0 Trigger an action.\u00a0\n8. Choose from the list of actions. Example,\u00a0 Show section.\n9. In the\u00a0 Create Action r ight pane, specify the section to be shown. In this scenario,\u00a0 Commercial Vehicle\ndetails \u00a0section.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-conditional-layouts\nIf you have further conditions and actions, you can specify them as required in a similar way.\nResult of the layout rule\nNow when you create a lead in the Motor Insurance layout, the Commercial Vehicle details section is displayed\nonly when you select Commercial Vehicle type. Otherwise, it is hidden.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-conditional-layouts\nActions that can be triggered\nThere are four actions that can be triggered when layout rule criteria are met.\nShow Field : Choose this action when you want specific fields to be shown only when the prescribed criteria\nare met.\nShow Section : Choose this action when you want specific sections to be shown only when the prescribed\ncriteria are met.\nSet Mandatory Fields : Choose this action when you want to make a few fields mandatory only when the\nprescribed criteria are met.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-conditional-layouts\nShow Subforms: \u00a0Choose this action when you want the subform to be shown only when the prescribed\ncriteria are met.\nExample:\nIn the same Zylker Insurance scenario, assume the following conditions.\n1. You want to display the field\u00a0 Type of Insurance \u00a0only if\u00a0 What are you looking for? \u00a0field is chosen as\u00a0\nInsurance .\n2. You want the\u00a0 Dependent Information \u00a0section to be displayed only when you select the type of insurance\nas\u00a0 Life Insurance . Otherwise, it is hidden.\n3. Upon choosing\u00a0 Life Insurance , you want the\u00a0 Dependent's Name \u00a0and\u00a0 Date of Birth \u00a0to be mandatory.\nFor a vehicle insurance policy, dependent details are not mandatory.\n4. You want to display the\u00a0 Life Insurance Details \u00a0subform, only when the type of insurance chosen is\u00a0 Life\nInsurance . If not the subform should be hidden.\nIn these cases, the following could be layout rules and actions.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-conditional-layouts\nAs you can see, based on specific field values, you can make fields, sections and subforms appear or disappear\nand mark fields as mandatory. This makes your layout very dynamic.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-conditional-layouts\nPoints to Remember\nClick here \u00a0to make a note of the instances when field updates take precedence over layout rules.\nThe \u00a0[Record] Owner \u00a0field currently cannot be chosen as the primary field that controls the layout rule.\nLayout Rules are applied on Create/edit and view pages.\nLayout Rules cannot be used on the following field types:\nAuto Number\nLookup\nMulti Select Lookup\nUser Lookup\nFormula\nFile Upload\nMulti Line\nLayout rules are not available for records generated via import, webforms, lead convert page. In case of\ncreating or editing records via APIs, only \"Set Mandatory Field\" action is supported.\nWhile choosing trigger actions, the\u00a0 Show Subform \u00a0option will be available only if a subform is present in\nthe chosen layout.\nWhen you edit a primary field used in a layout rule, if there are mandatory fields associated to the rule, these\nmandatory fields will be captured via a popup prompt.\nFor example, let's say you have a layout rule saying, \"If\u00a0 Amount > 50000 USD,\u00a0 make\u00a0 Discount\n\u00a0mandatory\". When you edit the Amount field from the Record Detail page, the Discount field will be\nprompted via a popup window.\nNote:\nThe field set as the primary field for a layout rule, can further be included in the \"Show Field and \"Set\nMandatory Fields\" actions. For instance if a rule is based on a primary field \"Type of Vehicle\",\u00a0 a newly\ncreated layout rule \"Vehicle Insurance\" can show or set the field \"Type of Vehicle\" as mandatory during\nthe configuration.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-page-layouts/articles/create-conditional-layouts\nSimilarly, fields mandated by the layout rules will be verified as mentioned below:\nIf you have configured a layout rule based on a Deal Stage, when you edit the stage from the Detail page,\nBlueprint or the Pipeline view, the fields mandated by the layout rule will be captured via a popup\nwindow.\nIf you have configured a layout rule based on Task Status - Example, you have mandated a Description\nfield when a Task is Closed. In such a case, when you close a task from the Activities Related List /\nKanban View / Home page or custom view, CRM will verify layout rule, before closing the task and\nprompt the fields as mandated by the rule.\nLayout rule support is been given to Kanban view so, drag and drop will evaluate layout rule.\nLayout rules are also effective on approval of records.\nLayout rules cannot be created based on a Multi-select picklist field as the primary field.\u00a0\nLayout Rules Limits\u00a0\nMaximum rules allowed - 10 per layout\nMaximum parent conditions allowed - 25\nMaximum branch conditions allowed - 5 per parent condition\u00a0\nMaximum branch conditions criteria allowed - 5 per branch condition\u00a0\nMaximum actions allowed - 25 per branch condition\n(The total number\u00a0is inclusive of all actions.

To accomplish these activities the administrators provide users with appropriate\naccess levels to various modules, records or fields.\nWhen it comes to email sharing it can be tedious to decide and set individual user's access levels each time a new\nuser joins the org or shifts departments or is promoted to a higher role. As a solution, Zoho CRM has Email\npreferences, which makes it easier to set up email sharing permissions as it is set at the role-level.\nSetting up Email Preferences\nEmail preference allows users with administrator profile to set email sharing permissions based on roles. For\nexample, if the organization requires all Assistant Manager's to share emails with their colleagues as and when\nneeded, then it is much easier to set the email sharing permission for this role as User's preference. This way any\nuser who is in the Assistant Manager's role will have the same privilege.\nThus, as soon as a user is assigned a role the pre-defined email sharing permission is automatically applied. In\naddition, the excluded domains and the list of users or roles with whom emails can be shared will also be\napplicable.\nTo set email sharing preferences\n1. Go to Setup > Channels > Emails > Email Configuration > Email Sharing.\nNote\nEmails of users in a role will be shared with the members in the immediate superior role by default.\nThis cannot be edited.\nIf the sharing permission is modified for existing users then their previous permissions will be\noverwritten.\nIf an existing user's sharing permission is updated, such that there is a mismatch between the\npermissions given to the user and his role, then the role based permission will take precedence.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-configuration/articles/setting-email-preferences\n2. Click Preferences.\n3. Go to a particular role and under Sharing, select a permission from the drop-down list.\n4.

The contact creator is part of any one territory of the\naccount.\n4.

For more details, refer to the Assignment of\nAccounts table.\nWith the above use cases, if the system does not determine a single territory then territory will not be\nassigned to the contact.\nTerritory Assignment for Deals (Opportunities)\nDeals are always associated to Contacts and/or Accounts. Hence, the territory to which a deal should be assigned\nto is based on the contact or account it is associated to.\u00a0Note that if you have enabled\u00a0Deal Rule for\nTerritories\u00a0then the deals are further validated based on the deal rule and then territories are assigned.\nLet us say your organization distributes the deals based on the deal amount or size. You have one territory named\nUS and two sub territories named Big deals and Regular Deals. The bigger deals worth more that $5000 are\nassigned to an experienced sales rep whereas the deals less than $4000 are assigned to two other team members.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/territory-management/articles/assign-territories\nIn this case your deals from US will be assigned to the US territory, but to further assign the deal to the\nappropriate\u00a0Big deals\u00a0or\u00a0Regular Deals, you can use Deal Rules. Each of these territories can have a deal rule\ncreated that has the criteria to filter out the deals.\u00a0\u00a0\nAs the first step, deals are assigned to territories based on the associated contact or account.\u00a0\nContact associated to the Deal\u00a0- If the contact associated to the deal has a territory assigned to it the same will be\nassigned to the deal. Additionally, if the Deal Rule is enabled, CRM will check for Deal Rules in that territory and\nassign accordingly.\nAccount associated to the Deal\u00a0- If the contact associated to the deal does not have a territory assigned to it,\nCRM will check for the Account associated to the deal. It will then assign the territory based on the Deal Rules, if\nany.\u00a0\nIf there are sub territories,\nThe system will check the first level territories for Deal Rule. If none exists, it will skip to the second level\nand check. The system will not check further if no Deal Rule is available in the second level as well.\nWhen the Deal Rules exists in the first level territory in the hierarchy, but the record does not satisfy the\ncriteria, then the system will not check the second level.\nNote:\nIf a deal does not satisfy the criteria of the Deal Rules, or more than one territories seem to match then the\nterritory is simply assigned based on the account or contact it is associated to. Refer to the table below for\nmore details.\nAlso, territories will be reassigned to deals, if the associated account or contact is modified. Here are some\nbusiness scenarios:\nScenarios - Contacts\nWhat will happen?\nAn account or contact is not associated to the\ndeal.\nTerritory will not be assigned to the deal.\nThe contact associated to the deal has a single\nterritory.\nThe contact's territory will be assigned to the deal.\nThe contact associated to the deal has multiple\nterritories.\nTerritories will be assigned based on the following criteria for:\n1.

The deal creator is part of any one territory of the account.\n4. The deal creator is the territory manager of any one\nterritory of the account.\nTerritory Reassignment When Records Are Modified\nFor accounts, the associated child records are contacts and deal. When an account is modified and falls into\nanother territory, the associated contact and deal may also be reassigned to a different territory. The following\ntable will provide details on the various use cases when the parent record is modified.\nHere are some business scenarios:\nParent records that are modified\nWhat will happen to the associated records?\nA record that was part of two or more territories is\nnow reassigned to a new territory.\nRecords will be reassigned to the new single territory.\nA record that was assigned to only one territory is\nnow assigned to additional territories.\nRecords will remain assigned to the parent record's territory.\nIt will not be assigned to the new additional territories.\nA record that was assigned to only one territory is\nnow reassigned to new territories.\nRecords will not be assigned to the new territories.

If\nyou enable Deal Rules, you can run rules for deals as well.\nYou can look up records and assign them to territories using one of the three options listed below:\nBy Territory\u00a0- Records from the selected territories will be listed. You can select the records and assign\nthem to territories.\nBy Custom View\u00a0- When you have the records sorted using list views, it is easier to view and assign them\nto the appropriate territories.\nApply my own criteria\u00a0- When both the options above do not serve the purpose, you can always define a\nset of criteria to filter records. This option, allows you to modify the set of criteria using the\u00a0Change\nPattern\u00a0option.\nTo search records and assign to territories\n1. Go to\u00a0Setup\u00a0> Security Control\u00a0>\u00a0Territory Management\u00a0>\u00a0Assign Territories.\n2. Choose Accounts or Deals from the drop-down.\n3.

It's an\nimportant factor that they use to determine if the emails from your organization are trustworthy enough to be\ntransmitted to the inbox or not.\nWhy is it important to measure email credibility?\nFrom daily correspondences to targeted marketing, businesses rely on emails to perform various sales and\nmarketing activities. Because of this practice, recipients' inboxes are often cluttered by newsletters, periodic\npromotions, or cold sales emails from various sources. This accumulation of emails makes it hard for recipients to\ndistinguish useful emails and promotions from spam messages clogging their inboxes.\nIn order to control spamming attempts, internet service providers have started to scrutinize all incoming emails for\ncredibility and deliver only the valid and trustworthy ones to the inbox. Upon assessing your emails, these\nproviders rate the sender's IP address with credibility scores, based on which it determines whether a given email\nshould be directed to the inbox or to the spam folder.\nThus, to increase your email deliverability and yield more email conversions, it's important that you maintain a\nhealthy credibility score.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-capabilities/articles/email-credibility-in-zoho-crm\nHow does Zoho CRM ensure email credibility?\nEmail credibility score, although a rating based on individual emails, impacts other emails that are sent using the\nsame server. In this case, the poor or average email credibility score of one CRM organization hampers the score\nof other CRM organizations using Zoho's shared email sending infrastructure.\nIn order to curb this domino effect, help mitigate poor credibility scores, and help you to self-assess your senders'\nreputation , Zoho CRM analyzes your email sending practices and provides you with an email credibility report.\nBased on bounce volume and the number of spam complaints reported on the sender's IP address, the credibility\nreport displays three analyses:\nCredibility score and recommended actions\nBounce report\nCredibility score trend\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-capabilities/articles/email-credibility-in-zoho-crm\nCredibility score and recommended actions\nThe credibility score is a numerical value set on a scale of 1 to 100, where any score above 70 is considered a\ngood score.\nThe following are score ranges, for reference:\n>70 - Good\n40 to 70 - Average\n30 to 39 - Bad\n<30 - Very bad\nYour score is generated by assessing the number of spam complaints and bounce volume accrued over time.

Many businesses that send\u00a0out\u00a0bulk emails like\u00a0newsletters, notifications, invitations, automatic transactional\nemails etc. to their customers\u00a0regularly, face higher chances of\u00a0spamming and sometimes even the authenticity of\nan email becomes questionable. In such cases, a relay server can be beneficial.\u00a0Let's see some of the benefits that\nrelay servers can provide:\nNot all, but few organizations are required to store copies of emails that are sent to the recipients as part of\ntheir compliance goals. If the emails are routed through the relay server, you can always keep a backup of\nthe sent emails in the server.\nOften, important transactions and messages are shared with the customers via email. It's best to have access\nto all such emails and attachments sent by your employees even after they discontinue service in your\norganization. You may need them for reference in the future.\nSometimes emails are prone to virus threats and to prevent a potential malware attack on the recipients'\nsystems, it's best to run antivirus checks on the outbound emails before sending it to the customers.\nThe bulk emails are intended to address a large population and therefore consist of content that is common\nfor all the recipients. Just in case, you want to share some additional information such as disclaimers,\nnotices or promotions\u00a0with selected sets of customers, then instead of sending separate emails, you can just\nappend the information to\u00a0the outbound emails before sending.\u00a0\nOftentimes emails are prone to spoofing, where the email header is tampered with to give an appearance of\nspam email. Sending emails from the relay server can help you avoid it.\u00a0\nThe bounced and failed delivery emails can be accessed from the relay server.\nPoints to consider before setting up a relay server\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-configuration/articles/crm-set-up-email-relay\nYou can only send emails that originate from Zoho CRM via the relay server. That is workflow emails,\nindividual emails, and mass emails. You may choose to send all or either of these emails from a relay server.\nYou can manually set limits to the number of emails (only the above-mentioned emails) that can be sent\nfrom the relay server.\u00a0\nEmails that are sent from the Zoho CRM's server will continue to be sent from this server and the per-day\nlimits\u00a0of the outbound emails will depend on your subscription.\u00a0\nIt is advisable to whitelist all the IP addresses of Zoho CRM in your relay server to avoid any deliverability\nissues. But, note that whitelisting IPs\u00a0may be necessary\u00a0if you set up an open relay server (an SMTP server\nthat allows\u00a0not just mail destined to or originating from known users but\u00a0every user to send emails).\u00a0\nAuthenticating Email Protocols In Relay Server\nWhen a relay server is not set\u00a0\nThe outbound emails originate from the user's domain (@company.com) and are sent to the recipient via Zoho\nCRM's server. To receive the delivery failed and bounced emails, the return path\u00a0(variable envelope from address)\nis set to Zoho CRM's server. This change causes a mismatch of IP addresses between the originating email and\nreturn path that fails an essential email authentication protocol, called SPF. To avoid deliverability issues, Zoho\nCRM signs DKIM (alternate\u00a0email authentication protocol). Signing DKIM ensures that the emails pass the\nDMARC policy and are successfully\u00a0delivered.\nWhen a relay server is set\nThe outbound emails are sent from Zoho CRM's server to the relay server from where they are sent to the\nrecipients. Some vendors tend to change the return path of the emails to their server to manage the bounced and\nfailed delivery emails within the relay server.\u00a0\nOnce a relay server is set there are two possibilities concerning the return paths:\u00a0\nIf the return path is retained as Zoho CRM's server\ni. The outbound email is sent from\u00a0Zoho CRM's server\u00a0to the relay server. At this point, the IP\naddress of the originating email is authenticated\u00a0against the IP address mentioned in the return path.\nSince the return path is retained to Zoho CRM's server, both the IP addresses will match resulting in\nSPF validation to pass.\u00a0\nNote that sending emails through the relay server does not change the email limit that is set for an\nedition. For example, as per the subscribed CRM edition if your daily limit for sending emails is\n5000 emails/day, then you can set aside some number of emails, like 2000 to be sent from the relay\nserver. The remaining 3000 emails will be sent from the Zoho CRM server.\u00a0\nNote: If you want to access\u00a0the bounced emails\u00a0(stored in the relay server) within CRM, you can do so by\nfetching the bounce management data from the relay server and integrating it with CRM using API.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-configuration/articles/crm-set-up-email-relay\nii. The email is then\u00a0sent to the recipient from the relay server, at this point another IP address\nauthentication will be carried out between the email origination and return path. This time, the\noriginating email's IP address is the relay server and the return path's IP address is Zoho CRM's\nserver, which will cause SPF failure due to a mismatch of IP addresses. Because of this, the email\ndeliverability will be unsuccessful and the email may land as spam in the recipient's inbox.\u00a0\nTo prevent such instances, it is recommended to enable DKIM (it automatically passes the DMARC policy) which\nin turn ensures successful email delivery.\nIf the return path is set to relay server\ni. The outbound email is sent from Zoho CRM's server to the relay server. An IP address authentication\nis carried out and the originating email's IP will match with that of the return path which will result in\nSPF validation.\u00a0\nii. The email will be sent to the recipient from the relay server and the IP authentication will display a\nmatch of IP addresses because in this case, both the originating email and return paths have the same\nIP\u00a0addresses (relay server). This will result in SPF validation and the email will be delivered\nsuccessfully.\u00a0\u00a0\nWhitelist Zoho CRM IPs in the Relay Server\nEmails may be sent to the relay server from different IP addresses of\u00a0Zoho CRM and to prevent any unsuccessful\ndeliveries as a result of IP mismatch it is essential to\u00a0whitelist all our IPs in the relay server. It is mandatory to\nwhitelist the IPs if an open relay server (it uses IPs as a\u00a0criteria to filter the\u00a0inbound emails) is used. Though it is\nnot necessary, to whitelist these IPs in the relay servers that use the host's username and password as an\nauthentication mechanism,\u00a0it is still recommended to publish these IPs in the relay servers.\nServer Name\u00a0(Accessing URL)\nIP addresses\nUS DC\n(crm.zoho.com)\n204.141.42.0/23\u00a0\n136.143.190.0/23\u00a0\n136.143.186.0/23\u00a0\nNote\nThe return path is by default set to Zoho CRM's address and many vendors don't change it to relay\nserver's address. Since SPF failure in these cases is inevitable, it is mandatory to enable DKIM and\nensure the DMARC policy is signed.\u00a0\nWe recommend you sign DKIM with Zoho CRM to rule out any possibilities of unsuccessful\ndelivery.

To do so, you will need to mention the\nhost's name and password on the certificate.\u00a0\u00a0\nAvailability\u00a0\u00a0\nSetting the type of emails sent from the relay server\u00a0\nYou can select the type of emails that should be sent\u00a0via the relay server. Only the emails that originate from CRM\nsuch as workflow emails, mass emails or individual emails can be sent through a relay server. You can use\ndifferent relay servers for each type of email, for example, you can use server one to send all the mass emails and\nserver two to send all the workflow-related emails.\u00a0\u00a0\nSetting daily email limit from the relay server\u00a0\u00a0\nYou can specify the number of emails that should be sent daily from the relay server. Once the maximum limit is\nreached, the subsequent emails will be sent from the CRM server.\u00a0\nManaging bounced emails\nBounce management with Zoho CRM provides an option to configure an email address to which the bounced\nemails will be sent. Say, when you send out packages using any delivery services company, you mention the\nrecipient\u2019s address and the address the package must be returned to in case the package couldn\u2019t be delivered.\nSimilarly, the emails we send out have the recipient\u2019s address and a return path. A return path is an email address\nwhere the emails that couldn\u2019t be delivered are returned. In CRM, the default return path is the Zoho CRM\nmailbox and it processes the bounced emails by\u00a0updating the email status to 'Bounced' in Zoho CRM under the\nrelated lists, sales signal, reports and smart filters.\u00a0\nWith the 'Bounce management with Zoho CRM' option, Zoho CRM will be set as the return path to receive\nbounce emails. i.e. Whenever an email gets bounced, the bounce report will be sent to the Zoho CRM\nmailbox and the email status will be updated as 'Bounced.\nSome relay servers accept addresses as return paths that are already configured with the relay server. In that\ncase,\u00a0users can configure the server to allow the following domains. Update these DC-specific domains in\nyour relay server to continue receiving bounce mail reports back to Zoho CRM.\nCN\ncatchall@relay.zoho-crm.com.cn\nEU\ncatchall@relay.eu.zohocrm.com\nUS\ncatchall@relay.zohocrm.com\nIN\ncatchall@relay.zohocrm.in\nAU\ncatchall@relay.zoho-crm.com.au\nPermission Required\u00a0\u00a0\nUsers with administrative permission in their profile can access this feature.\u00a0\u00a0\nCheck Feature Availability and Limits\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-configuration/articles/crm-set-up-email-relay\nJP\ncatchall@relay.zohocrm.jp\u00a0\nWhen the relay server does not allow Zoho CRM as the return path then the user should disable Bounce\nmanagement in the Zoho CRM option and set the return path as the relay server in two ways:\n1. Set 'From address' as the default return path \u2013 The sender 'From email address' will be set as the\nreturn path and the bounce report (if the mail is bounced) will be directly sent to this address.\n2. Set custom email address as default return path \u2013 The user can set an email address, belonging to the\ndomain configured with the relay server, as the return path. This option is ideal when the user wants\nto receive the reports of bounced emails, originating from different 'From addresses'\u00a0in a common\nmailbox. Say for instance you have the following email addresses - amelia@zylker.com,\npatricia@zylker.com, and\u00a0jennie@zylker.com. You can set a common email address\nbounce@zylker.com as the return path which receives the reports of bounced emails, originating from\nthe email addresses mentioned above.\nTo configure the email relay setting\u00a0\n1.

For\nexample, you can segregate the leads based on their status or categorize the sales depending on different\nstages.\u00a0This sort of information gives\u00a0better insights about the potential bottlenecks and lets you fix them\neffectively.\u00a0\nBelow is an instance, where the leads are listed down based on their current state\u00a0along with their probable\nrevenues. The information is displayed in two ways:\u00a0List View\u00a0and\u00a0Kanban View.\nIn comparison to List View, where all the records are listed\u00a0one after the other, a Kanban view segregates your\ndata based upon the lead status giving a clearer picture. You can also view the aggregate revenue under each\nstatus. You can create such kanban views for all modules except Tasks, Calls, Meetings, Visits, Finances. There\nare two types of Kanban views in Zoho CRM: Pre-defined and Customizable.\nNote. he following modules do not have the customizable option:\nTask\nCall\nMeetings\nSocial\nVisits\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/managing-module-views/articles/kanban-views\nA)\u00a0Pre-defined\u00a0\u2013 Pre-defined kanban views are available for\u00a0 Tasks, Calls, Meetings, Social, Visits, Deals,\u00a0and\nSalesInbox and can be viewed by users in\u00a0all the editions. Below is the CRM view for\u00a0Activities\u00a0module that\u00a0is\ncategorized based on Customers, Open Deals, Leads/Contacts and Others.\nB)\u00a0Customizable\u00a0\u2013 You can create a customized Kanban view for any module. To create a kanban view you have\nto enter the following details:\nKanban View name\u00a0- You can enter any name for the kanban view created, for example, \"Lead Details\".\nCategorize by\u00a0- Select the category in which you want to segregate the data, for example \"Lead Status\".\nAggregate by\u00a0- Select a currency for which you want the aggregated value. For example \"Expected revenue,\ncost per conversion, cost per click etc. \". A summed up value for each category will be displayed.\nNote. This field is not mandatory. The user can configure them according to their usage. The supported\nfields are integer, decimal, currency, formula, rollup summary.\nSelect Fields\u00a0- Select the\u00a0fields\u00a0that you want to view within\u00a0each record.\nHeader style - Choose mono color or random colors for the headers.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/managing-module-views/articles/kanban-views\nYou can create multiple Kanban views per module (which will vary depending on the edition).\nUsers will have the ability to save multiple Kanban views, each with a different 'Categorize By' field. This will\nhelp streamline the user experience, making it more convenient and less laborious for users who regularly utilize\nthe Kanban view.\nFor instance, a user at an events company wants to track their events by multiple statuses.\nEvent Promotions Status -\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0

Before you start building a kiosk in Zoho CRM, it helps if you have a clear idea of the capability you\nwant to provide. It's important to ask yourself questions like:\nWhat is the purpose of the kiosk?\nHow does the user get this work done now? What are the friction points?\nWhere can the kiosk be located to make it convenient for people?\nWhat are the steps in the flow of the kiosk? What details need to be displayed or collected in each?\nWhat should be automated and when should the automatic actions be fired? Should updates happen after\neach step or would I rather have it all done at the end?\nHow will I test the kiosk?\nOnce you have a clear idea how your kiosk should work, you can start the process of creating one in CRM.\nManage kiosks\nYou can create new kiosks and manage existing ones by navigating to Setup > Customization > Kiosk Studio.\nOn this page, you will find the following:\n1.

With a CRM system they can effectively manage to store sales and customer information in a\ncommon database, however, the employees may prefer to view the system in the language of their preference.\u00a0\nLet's consider an\u00a0organization is headquartered at Germany and operates out off US, Europe, and Japan. The\nlocale set in CRM is Germany and the preferred language as German. However, the sales personnel entering\ninformation in the system would prefer to view the fields in English or Japanese. Therefore, to address this\nrequirement Zoho CRM provides an option to translate\u00a0the fields and picklist values to an individual's preferred\nlanguage.\nAvailability\nBegin Translation\nTo begin translating language files, follow the steps below:\nStep 1. Switch On the Translation Settings\nThe first step is to turn on the translations settings. Before your begin, make sure you are logged in to your CRM\naccount with Administrative privileges.\nStep 2. Add Language\nThe second step is to add the language into your CRM account. In Zoho CRM, you can select a language from 28\npre-defined list of languages. When you add a language, a file is added that consists of a unique language code to\nidentify\u00a0the language. The file lists all the picklist values and custom fields in the default language of your CRM\naccount. One by one, you can add as many languages as you require and use the language files to translate them.\nPermission Required\nUsers with Administrative profile can access.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/translations/articles/translations\nStep 3. Export Language Files\nOnce you add the languages, the next step is to export the language file that you want to translate for your\norganization. An export file contains all the picklist values and the custom fields that need\u00a0to be translated. You\ncan choose to export individual file or export all the language files at once. Once the language file is exported,\nyou can translate the picklist values and custom fields in an export file either yourself or outsource to a vendor.

It is also one of the most tedious processes\nas it involves keeping up with large volumes of data. You need to collect as much information about the leads as\npossible in order to effectively follow up with them, convert them to qualified customers and strike business deals\nwith them.\u00a0\u00a0The less data you have on a leads, the less likely it is for you to convert them. Conversely, the more\ncomplete your data is on your leads, the better informed you are about their needs. This way, you are better placed\nto have more meaningful conversations with them.\nData such as the name of the lead, the company they are with, team/company size, region, branches, previous\ntransactions, their requirements and so on are crucial for lead conversion. This is why lead generation could be a\ntedious process \u2014 because there is just a lot of information to process and you may drown in this complexity and\nmiss out on recording appropriate details in your CRM for follow up. Remember, a missed lead is equal to a\nmissed opportunity.\nAdding to this complexity is the fact that there could be several sources of leads for you such as webforms,\nemails, calls, social media and third party references. You need to make sure that leads via all these channels are\nadded as individual lead records in your CRM system. While all of these sources are important, at this juncture,\nwe are going to talk only about emails. If you are struggling to keep up with the pace of email enquiries and are\nlooking for a more efficient way to record email enquiries in CRM, then Zoho CRM's Email parser is for you.\nWhen you should use email parser\u00a0\u00a0\u2014\u00a0\u00a0Business context\nEmail parser is ideal to be used when you receive a large volume of emails that follow a similar template on the\nbody of the email with certain variable values. For example, consider that you receive an enquiry email with the\nfollowing lead line:\n\"Hello. My name is\u00a0\u00a0John Smith\u00a0. I am the\u00a0\u00a0Head of Sales\u00a0\u00a0at\u00a0ABC\u00a0\u00a0Corp\u00a0\".\nYou receive a second email that says:\n\"Hello. My name is\u00a0\u00a0Erin Rocks\u00a0. I am the\u00a0\u00a0Vice President\u00a0\u00a0of\u00a0\u00a0XYZ Inc\u00a0\".\nSimilarly you may receive thousands of enquiries in this templated format, where the rest of the email content\nwould be the same, and the dynamic values that change would be the name of the sender, their title, company and\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-capabilities/articles/email-parser\n-overview\nother such details. In such cases, instead of manually creating records from these emails, you can simply instruct\nCRM to extract these dynamic values as CRM fields and automatically create records.\nLearn more\u00a0about how to configure email parser in Zoho CRM.\u00a0\n", "source": "email-parser-overview.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "gdpr-introduction", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/compliance-setting/gdpr/articles/gdpr\n-introduction\nZoho Corporation\nGDPR and Zoho CRM - An Introduction\nOn this page, we'll be taking a look at what the new rules in GDPR are and how Zoho CRM can help you\u00a0comply\nwith them.\u00a0We'll also help you understand how\u00a0to\u00a0protect your customers\u2019 data.\nGDPR and Zoho CRM\nGDPR and Zoho CRM\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new set of rules designed to provide EU\u00a0residents control over\nhow their personal data can be used by companies across the globe. At its core,\u00a0these rules aim to protect the data\nof its EU\u00a0residents.\u00a0This means organizations need to be well aware of the impact that this will\u00a0have on\nindividuals and businesses who deal with EU\u00a0residents' personal data. One also needs to be well-prepared to\nfollow consistent data protection compliance requirements.\nFirst, let's get familiar with\u00a0Controllers, Processors, and Data Subjects. It is essential to understand and identify\nthe difference in the roles of each.\nData Controller\u00a0 - Someone who controls the purpose and means of processing personal data. The controller\ndefines how the data should be put to use and why it should be used. Often, data controllers\u00a0use an external\nservice or another organization to process the data. This is where\u00a0data\u00a0processors come in. In this case,\ncontrol over\u00a0collected\u00a0personal data remains with the data controller and is not passed on.\nData Processor\u00a0 - Organizations that process personal data on behalf of the controller\u00a0are known as\nthe\u00a0data\u00a0processors. They do not have control over\u00a0what\u00a0is done with the data nor can they change the\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/compliance-setting/gdpr/articles/gdpr\n-introduction\npurpose of data collection. Processors get limited rights to process the data as per the instructions provided by\nthe controller.\nData Subject\u00a0 - The person whose personal information\u00a0you collect are the data subjects. In a business,\u00a0data\nsubjects tend to be your customers and employees. You collect information from them,\u00a0such as their name,\naddress, phone number,\u00a0and\u00a0email address,\u00a0to process and contact them for\u00a0business.\nZoho as a Data Processor\nA data processor must\u00a0have a secure system, tool,\u00a0and method to collect and store personal data.\u00a0Zoho CRM is\nequipped to comply\u00a0with the GDPR\u00a0as a data processor.

As administrators, you can add users to the organization's Zoho CRM\naccount, enabling your employees to carry out their day-to-day tasks independently.\u00a0\nAdding users in CRM is based on your editions and number of user licences. Each user can sign in to their\naccount with an email address and password. Every user is given a\u00a0\u00a0 role\u00a0 \u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0 profile\u00a0 . The profile determines\nwhat features a user is allowed to access and the role determines what data the user can access based on the\norganization's hierarchy.\u00a0\nSome of the add-ons and plug-ins in Zoho CRM need to be enabled for users before they can to access the feature,\nsuch as the mobile edition licenses, the Zoho Mail add-on, plug-in for Microsoft Outlook, and more.\u00a0\u00a0 See Also\u00a0\u00a0\nManage Profile\u00a0\nDefine and manage who has access to your Zoho CRM acc\nDefine and manage who has access to your Zoho CRM acc\u2026\nAvailability\u00a0\nTypes of user profiles\u00a0\nPermission Required\u00a0\nUsers with Manage User permission in their profile can access this feature.\u00a0\n \u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/organization-settings/user\n-management/articles/add-import-modify-re-invite-users\nAdministrators:\u00a0 \u00a0Users who can access\u00a0the entire system.

Once the account is created, the super admin should confirm the account. If an user is invited before\nconfirming, the invitation email will not be sent. The super admin should confirm the account and re-\ninvite the user.\n2. The Administrator adds a user by providing some basic details like name, email address, role, and\nprofile.\n3. You can also add multiple users by\u00a0importing a file\u00a0with\u00a0details like name, email, address, role and\nprofile.\n4. When the users are added manually, the\u00a0system automatically sends\u00a0an email invitation\u00a0to the user's\nemail address\u00a0. Other details such as phone\u00a0numbers, address, photo, fax, website, date of birth,\nlanguage, etc. can be entered after adding the user.\n5.

It prevents the data from\nbeing stolen or lost by converting the plain (or readable) text into cypher (or non-readable) text that is accessible\nonly to authorized parties. Even if a potential hacker gets a hold of the data, the information stored in the cypher\ntext is non-readable. \u00a0\nIn Zoho CRM you can encrypt custom fields using AES. Encrypting the data does not come in the way of the\neffective and quick use of Zoho CRM, by authorized users.\nAvailability\u00a0\nFeature Specifications\nField and Module-based specifications\nOnly Custom fields (both new and existing) can be encrypted. However, a field that is marked as unique\ncannot be encrypted directly. First, it must be unmarked as a unique field to enable encryption. Conversely,\na field that is already encrypted cannot be set as unique until the encryption is removed. In summary, a field\ncannot be both unique and encrypted simultaneously. To switch between these states, you must first\nremove the existing designation.\nFields that can be encrypted are\u00a0Single Line, Email, Phone, Number, Multiline (small), Date, Date-Time,\nCurrency, Decimal, Long Integer, and URL fields.\nData encryption is available for all standard (except Tasks, Calls, and Meetings) and custom modules.\u00a0\nEncryption can be disabled for a field at any time.\nIn Lead Conversion Mapping, data can be converted and stored only between two encrypted fields.\nEncrypted fields can be used as inputs in\u00a0Formula fields.\nHandling encrypted data\nFind & Merge and\u00a0Deduplication are supported for encrypted fields.\nAny data imported to encrypted fields will be encrypted by default and exported data are decrypted.\nPermission Required\nUsers with\u00a0an Administrator profile can access\u00a0this feature.\nCheck Feature Availability and Limits\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/data-encryption/articles/set-encryption\nEncrypted fields can be included in\u00a0Web forms.\nEncrypted field can be displayed in\u00a0Reports as a column, but cannot be used in Criteria and Columns to\nTotal.\nEncrypted fields can be used as inputs in\u00a0custom functions, and as merge fields in templates.\nAPIs are supported for encrypted data.\nEncrypted fields can be used in\u00a0integrations too. Utilizing the information in integrations is entirely at the\nuser's risk.\nLimitations and Trade-offs\nOnly full-text search is supported in global search.

In addition to encryption of data during transit, encryption of data when it is stored in the servers\nprovides an even higher level of security.

When a record\nis associated to a campaign, the user selects the member status manually to update the lead/contact's status.\nThus, the member status field values may not be the actual customer responses and are editable by the user.\nService Status\u00a0lists the values that are synchronized with the integrated campaigns. These values are the\ndirect campaign responses from the customer and cannot be edited by the user.\nLet's say, of all the recipients whom you targeted in the recent campaign, 12 have opened your email and clicked\nthe links in the email, 8 of them have registered to the upcoming webinar.\u00a0Now, using the advanced filter, you\ncan\u00a0sift through the target recipients based on their member status and service status to nurture further and engage\nthe respondents.\nTo filter leads or contacts based on campaign status\n1.

You don't need to run a separate\nreport - the time tracking filter called \"Untouched records\" will give you this picture.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/advanced-filters/articles/advanced-filters\nFollowing are the time tracking filters and their definitions:\nTouched Records: Gives you records that have been updated in the specified period. This includes changes\nmade to the related child\u00a0records as well.\nFor example, if you are running this filter on the\u00a0Contacts\u00a0module - and an associated deal has been edited in\nthe specified period. In this case, this contact will also be considered as \"touched\" or worked on and will be\ndisplayed in the results.\nUntouched Records:\u00a0Gives you records that have not been updated at all.\nFor example, if you are running this filter on the\u00a0Contacts\u00a0module - contacts which have not been updated at all\nin the given period, will be brought up by this filter.\nRecord Action: Records that have been modified in the specified period. This only brings up the records if any\nfield in the record has been edited. This does not include changes made to the\u00a0related child records.\nFor example, if you are running this filter on the\u00a0Contacts\u00a0module - contacts\u00a0whose direct fields have been\nedited will appear in the results. If an associated deal has been edited, this contact will not appear in the results.\nRelated Records Action: Gives you records, only when their\u00a0related child records have been updated.\nFor example, if you are running the filter on the\u00a0Contacts\u00a0module, and an associated deal has been updated, this\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/advanced-filters/articles/advanced-filters\nIn essence,\u00a0Touched Records = Record Action + Related Records Action.\nIn all of these filters, you will find the following parameters in the criteria:\nUser and System:\u00a0Refers to the records updated both by the user and the system.\nUser or System:\u00a0Refers to the records updated either by the user or the system.\nBy User:\u00a0Refers to combination of records updated by (User and system) + (Only by user).\nBy System:\u00a0Refers to records updated by the combination of records touched by (User and system) + (Only\nby System).\nOnly by User:\u00a0Refers to the records touched only by the users and not the system.\nOnly by System:\u00a0Refers to the records touched only by the system and not the user.\nAct instantly on the insights discovered\nAdvanced\u00a0filters not only enable you to discover quick insights but also follow up on the results obtained.

You can select records and assign suitable followup activities or run macros on them.\nFilter records using Visitor Tracking information\nThe purpose of having a website is complete only when you are able to keep a track of who visits it, make\ninferences about how people use it, when exactly they visit it etc. This information will help you serve your web\nvisitors better and convert those visits to customers.\nThat said, advanced filters in CRM can help you make such inferences about leads and contacts who visit your\nwebsite with the help of visitor tracking parameters. You will be able to filter out leads and contacts based on\nfields such as Average Time Spent on the site, chats missed, browser used to visit the site and so on. Following are\na few scenarios in which visitor tracking information could help you make some important inferences.\nFollow up with important contacts through missed chats\nLet's say you have a list of contacts who are at a particular stage of conversion. For instance, you have contacts\nwith whom you're closing deals this month. You can drill down more specifically by selecting a potential amount\nfor these deals. Some of these contacts may have messaged you on chat, but you might well have missed those\nmessages. Through advanced filters, you can instantly filter out these contacts. Here's how:\n1. Go to the\u00a0Contacts\u00a0module.\n2. Under\u00a0Filter Contacts By, select these combinations.\na. Select\u00a0Deal Amount >= 50,000\nb.

Click\u00a0Apply Filter.\u00a0\nYou can select any number of search combinations like this, based on your specific needs.\nTrack leads based on the average time spent on your website\nTracking your leads based on the average time they've spent on your website is also an effective way of\nconverting them to deals. When your leads are spending more time on the site, you know that they're\ninterested.Take these steps to track them:\n1. Go to the\u00a0Leads\u00a0module.\n2. Go to the\u00a0Visitor Tracking\u00a0section.\n3. Click\u00a0Average Time Spent (Minutes).\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/advanced-filters/articles/advanced-filters\n4. Select\u00a0>= 1 minute\u00a0from the picklist.\n5. Click\u00a0Apply Filter.\nTracking leads based on email address of attender\nYou have filtered out contacts based on their stages in the sales pipeline. Sales managers can track the\nprogress that their sales reps have made by entering the email address of the sales rep who has attended to\nspecific leads. Let's say, for instance that you're searching for leads associated with Charles Stone, your sales\nrep. Here's what you'll do:\n1. Go to the\u00a0Visitor Tracking\u00a0section.\n2. Click\u00a0Attended By.\n3. Type the email address of the sales rep.

Click\u00a0Apply Filter.\u00a0\nNow, all leads that Charles Stone has attended to will be displayed.\nBrowser compatibility\nWhen you filter leads based on what browser your leads have used, it becomes easier to enhance the design\nof that website for that browser. Say, for instance, you are looking for leads who have used Google Chrome to\naccess your website. If a large number of leads are found through the filter, you can improve the browser\ncompatibility.\n", "source": "advanced-filters.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "marking-personal-fields", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/compliance-setting/gdpr/articles/marking-personal-fields\nZoho Corporation\nMarking Personal Fields\nGDPR defines personal data as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (i.e. the data\nsubject).

Encrypting the data does not come in the way of the\neffective and quick use of Zoho CRM, by authorized users.\nAvailability\u00a0\nFeature Specifications\nField and Module-based specifications\nOnly Custom fields (both new and existing) can be encrypted. However, a field that is marked as unique\ncannot be encrypted directly. First, it must be unmarked as a unique field to enable encryption. Conversely,\na field that is already encrypted cannot be set as unique until the encryption is removed. In summary, a field\ncannot be both unique and encrypted simultaneously. To switch between these states, you must first\nremove the existing designation.\nFields that can be encrypted are\u00a0Single Line, Email, Phone, Number, Multiline (small), Date, Date-Time,\nCurrency, Decimal, Long Integer, and URL fields.\nData encryption is available for all standard (except Tasks, Calls, and Meetings) and custom modules.\u00a0\nEncryption can be disabled for a field at any time.\nIn Lead Conversion Mapping, data can be converted and stored only between two encrypted fields.\nEncrypted fields can be used as inputs in\u00a0Formula fields.\nHandling encrypted data\nFind & Merge and\u00a0Deduplication are supported for encrypted fields.\nAny data imported to encrypted fields will be encrypted by default and exported data are decrypted.\nPermission Required\nUsers with\u00a0an Administrator profile can access\u00a0this feature.\nCheck Feature Availability and Limits\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/data-encryption/articles/set-encryption\nEncrypted fields can be included in\u00a0Web forms.\nEncrypted field can be displayed in\u00a0Reports as a column, but cannot be used in Criteria and Columns to\nTotal.\nEncrypted fields can be used as inputs in\u00a0custom functions, and as merge fields in templates.\nAPIs are supported for encrypted data.\nEncrypted fields can be used in\u00a0integrations too. Utilizing the information in integrations is entirely at the\nuser's risk.\nLimitations and Trade-offs\nOnly full-text search is supported in global search. For instance, if the encrypted data is \"Joseph Wells,\" the\nencrypted field record does not show in the results of a search for \"Joseph.\"\nEncrypted fields cannot be used in Advanced Filters\nEncrypted fields cannot be found using Search by Criteria\nEncrypted fields are not visible in the Sort option.\nIn the\u00a0 Forecasts module, encrypted fields cannot be used as\u00a0 Target Fields.\nWhen a field is encrypted, the following operators will be supported in the criteria:\u00a0\na. Single line, Phone, Email, Small multi-line (character limit of 2000), Date, Date-Time, and Currency\n- is empty and is not empty\nb. Number, Decimal, Long integer - =, !=, is empty, and is not empty.\u00a0\nFile encryption:\u00a0All the attachments are encrypted by default once added to CRM.\u00a0\nEmail encryption: Emails sent and received via CRM will be encrypted at rest.\nRead more about how data encryption takes place at Zoho.\nTo encrypt/decrypt custom fields:\n1.

In addition to encryption of data during transit, encryption of data when it is stored in the servers\nprovides an even higher level of security. EAR protects against any possible data leak due to server compromise\nor unauthorized access.\nEncryption is done at the application layer using the\u00a0AES-256\u00a0algorithm which is a symmetric encryption\nalgorithm and uses 128-bit blocks and 256-bit\u00a0keys. The\u00a0key used to convert the data from plain text to cypher\ntext is called Data Encryption Key(DEK). The DEK is further encrypted using the KEK (Key Encryption Key),\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/data-encryption/articles/set-encryption\nthus, providing yet another layer of security.

Besides, it also outlines the actions that you\nneed to perform in order to convert a prospect into a customer.\nStages in a Sales Pipeline?\nThere are multiple stages every sales team has, including tasks such as gathering leads and qualifying them:\n1.\u00a0 Prospecting\nIt is the process by which companies attract prospects into their customer database in the hope of nurturing them\nthrough a sales process and converting them into customers. They therefore make effort to generate an interest in\nthe prospects towards their products and services. There are various sources through which you can generate\nleads. Some of them include trade shows, email campaigns, social media, webforms, etc.\n2.\u00a0 Nurturing and Qualifying\nOnce you have generated prospects, you will need to ensure that they are the right fit for your business. Therefore,\nyou will need to qualify them and manage them. This is a crucial step in a sales process as it helps you prioritise\nthe promising leads and keep them at the top of your to-do list.\n3.\u00a0 Set Meetings and define prospect's needs\nNow, in order to get to know your prospects better, or in other words, understand their requirements, better, you\nneed to set up a meeting with them. After interacting with them on several occasions, you need to tailor your\nproposal to address their needs. So basically, it is crucial that you articulate how your products or services can\nhelp solve their problems.\n4.\u00a0 Negotiate and close deal\nYou have done your job of understanding your prospect's needs and built a solid relationship with them. While\nsome may be ready to purchase your products or services, in the case of other prospects, you may have to address\nfurther concerns - all of which will eventually help you provide your customers with exactly what they are\nlooking for. After these terms and conditions are finalized, you will be in a position to close the deal - either in\nsuccess or otherwise.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/pipelines/articles/multiple-sales-pipeline\nWhile most companies differ in terms of their method for follow-up, and stages in the sales pipeline. the top-level\nstages continue to remain the same for all.\nThey are:\nProspecting\nQualification\nProposal\u00a0\nClosing\nBenefits of a Sales Pipeline\n1. Get a better understanding of the sales process\n2. More efficient sales strategy\n3. A better understanding of the position of each lead in the sales funnel\n4. Less time spent in closing deals.\nManage your Sales Pipeline with Zoho CRM\nNow that you have understood the concept of a sales pipeline and its stages, imagine managing the same without a\ncentral process in place. Defining the stages in the sales pipeline and tracking the progress in the sales process\ncould be extremely challenging. With the help of a software like Zoho CRM, therefore, you can:\n1. Define stages in a sales pipeline\nIt is crucial to define the stages in your sales pipeline early on in order to have a strong sales process as\nsales reps in your company will know in advance what is expected of them in order to take the lead forward\nthrough the sales pipeline and finally close the deal. This can be achieved by customising/adding values in\nstage field within the Deals module in Zoho CRM. For instance, imagine you run a magazine publication.\nYou do not require some of the default values within the stage field, such as Value Proposition or Proposal.\nYou can therefore customise or delete these fields to meet your requirements.\n2. Track your deals\nIt is crucial to track your deals to get an idea of the entire progress of your deal and avoid any further errors\nand make better decisions in terms of your way forward. Also, it is crucial to keep track of all updates in\norder to avoid missing out on any vital information.\na) Historical analysis will help you avoid repeating mistakes that may have caused you to lose deals in the\npast. Therefore analysing your\u00a0 sales stage history\u00a0 in Zoho CRM is crucial as it will give you the number\nof potentials in each stage for a specific time period.\nb) Another method of tracking your sales pipeline within Zoho CRM is by creating\u00a0 reports and\ndashboards . You will be able to track your sales trends, marketing campaigns, team performance, etc. with\nthe help of these reports.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/pipelines/articles/multiple-sales-pipeline\nc) With multiple deals within your software, trying to view each of them to determine their status could\nprove to be quite taxing. However, within Zoho CRM, you can view your deals in a single view with the\nhelp of\u00a0 kanban \u00a0view. It will display the data in an organised manner.\n3. Identify priority deals to focus on\na) If you want to locate deals that are priority (for instance, deals that are closing this month), you can\nuse\u00a0advanced filters, which is a powerful search tool that can help you extract necessary information in no\ntime. In this case, therefore, you will be able to quickly locate deals that fit your criteria (deals that are\npriority) and then you can immediately follow-up on them.\nb) On the other hand, if you want the system to suggest deals that you need to prioritise, you can use\u00a0Zia,\nZoho CRM's data intelligence tool. Based on the trend, she will predict for you those deals that are most\nlikely to be won. This will give you a better understanding of what to focus on. In fact, she will create a\nview - breaking up your deals into those which are likely to be won, lost, or those which could go either\nway. This will help you shift your focus onto those deals that require your attention.\u00a0\nAvailability\nSales pipeline for deals\nIn any sales process, a deal has to pass through several stages until it is closed or lost. To make sure that deals are\nnot left stagnating in the same stage unnecessarily, the sales team needs to keep a close watch on their deals\npipeline. Our Deals module contains different stages including qualification, value proposition, negotiation, and\nclosed won that appear in a typical sales deal pipeline. These stages are available in a picklist field called Stage.\nYou can add as many stages as you like to the existing pipeline to reflect your sales process accurately. Here are\nsome of the ways a sales rep can benefit from a sales pipeline:\nVisualize and track the progress of a deal through each stage\nTake necessary actions based on the stage in the buying cycle\nMonitor how long a particular deal has stayed in a stage and take action to prevent stagnancy\nThe need for multiple sales pipelines for deals.\nZylker Cars is a car dealership company that has different sales processes for reselling used cars, selling new cars,\nand providing car servicing. Some of the basic sales stages will be similar across these three processes, but there\nPermission Required\nUsers with the Module Customization permission profile can access this feature.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/pipelines/articles/multiple-sales-pipeline\nwill also be significant differences. The flow chart below shows the different deal stages for each process:\nNew Cars\nUsed Cars\nService Requests\nGathering requirements\nShow available models\nRequest analysis\nTest drives and car selection\nTest drives and car selection\nRepair process (ongoing)\nPrice quote\nPrice quote\nQuality check and test drive\nNegotiation\nNegotiation\nBill generation\nClosed won/lost\nClosed won/lost\nService request/closed\nAs every process is different, putting all the deals through a single pipeline will not give a clear understanding of\ntheir progress. Therefore, Zylker Cars needs to create multiple sales pipelines to more accurately show how a deal\nis progressing.\nCreating multiple sales pipelines\nThe Deal Stage field is available by default in the Deals module, with some system defined stages such as:\nqualification, need analysis, value proposition, etc.\nStandard pipeline\nWhen you create a pipeline for the first time, we will create a system-defined standard pipeline and\nassociate all the records in the Deals module with it. This is done to make sure that every deal is associated\nto at least one pipeline.\nThe standard pipeline will be created with the stages that are present in the Stage picklist field.\nYou can rename and customize this pipeline to meet your requirements. The standard pipeline will not be\ncreated if you do not have any records in the layout or if there is no Blueprint created for the Stage field.\nLayout specificity\nPipelines are layout specific and you can create multiple pipelines for each layout. For example, you have a layout\nfor sales and are selling two categories of products, furniture and furnishings, which have different sales\nprocesses. You can create two pipelines in the Sales layout, one for each category.\nMoving a deal from one pipeline to another\nThe Deals module has a Stage field which is used for the default pipeline. If you create multiple pipelines in a\nlayout, you can move a record from one pipeline to another manually (within the layout). You can also use the\nMass Update feature to move a batch of records at once.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/pipelines/articles/multiple-sales-pipeline\nProbability value of a stage\nEach stage in a pipeline will be assigned a probability value. If you are using the same stage in different pipelines,\nthe same value will be used.\nWhen you create a new pipeline, you can create new stages and assign probability values to them, but you cannot\nmodify the probability for the existing stages from the pipeline creation screen. You need to go to Stage\nProbability Mapping to change the probability for other stages.\nIf you set the forecast category to Pipeline, Closed, or Omitted in Stage-Probability Mapping then the deal stage\nwill be Open, Closed Won, or Closed Lost respectively.\nTo create a sales pipeline\n1.

Select the\u00a0Set as Default\u00a0checkbox if you want this pipeline to be the default when creating a deal.\n9. Click\u00a0Save.\nModifying the stages in the pipeline\nIf your sales process is modified at any point, you can add or remove stages from the pipeline. The stages that you\nremove from a pipeline will not be deleted from CRM, they will still be available in the stage builder.\nTo modify the stages\n1.

Click\u00a0Save.\nHow do pipeline and deal stages influence other CRM activities?\nMass updating records\nWhen you mass update records, keep in mind that a pipeline is layout specific and the stages in it are specific to a\nparticular pipeline. During the mass update, records will always be checked for a match in the following order:\nLayout > Pipeline > Stage. (You can mass update the layout, pipeline field, and stage field on records).\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/pipelines/articles/multiple-sales-pipeline\nMass update the Layout field\nIf you want to update the layout of multiple deals, you must also define the pipeline to move them to and the stage\nthey will have.\nNote that you will only need to select a pipeline if the layout has one; otherwise you can just select the desired\nlayout and update the record.\nMass update the Pipeline field\nSince a pipeline is closely linked to a layout, when you mass update the pipeline for records, CRM will check\nwhether the records belong to the layout you want to move them to. For example, imagine that you have two\nlayouts: Sales and Services, each of which has two pipelines. If you select some deals from the list view and move\nthem to a pipeline that belongs to the Sales layout, then only the deals that already belong to the Sales layout will\nbe moved. The remaining deals will be skipped because they are from a different layout.\nMass update only the Stage field\nIf you only want to update the Stage field, the records with the selected stage in their pipeline will be updated.\nThe other records will be skipped. For example, if you choose the stage field to be updated to Negotiation, then\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/pipelines/articles/multiple-sales-pipeline\nonly the records that have Negotiation in their pipeline will be updated, others will be skipped.\nCreating a blueprint based on the sales pipeline\nThe Stage field is often used in Blueprints. Generally, Blueprints are layout specific, but if you have created\npipelines in the layout, they are pipeline specific. If you create a blueprint based on the Stage field, you will be\nrequired to select the pipeline it is associated to. All the values in the Stage field will be used in designing the\nblueprint.\nNote\nPipeline and Stage fields can also be updated through macros, workflow rules, Blueprints, and\nfollow-up actions (field updates) after sending mass emails.\nIf the Stage field is used as a criteria in a layout rule or validation rule, then the Stage field and its\ndependent fields (Pipeline and Layout) will not appear in the mass update options.\nIf the Pipeline field is used as a criteria in a layout rule or validation rule, then the Pipeline field\nand its dependent field (Layout) will not appear in the mass update options.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/pipelines/articles/multiple-sales-pipeline\nImporting data based on the sales pipeline\nWhen importing records, the Pipeline field needs be mapped so that deals are automatically assigned to the\nrespective pipelines.\nImporting deals for a different pipeline: If you want to import records that belong to different pipelines,\nyou need to add a column to the import file for details of the pipeline that the record belongs to. Map this\nfield with CRM's Pipeline field when you import.\nImporting deals for the same pipeline: Pipeline is a mandatory field, so if the import file does not have\nthe pipeline details then all the imported deals can be assigned to one selected pipeline. You can select a\npipeline in Assign Default Value.\nNote\nIf you include a new stage in the blueprint, it will be automatically added to the pipeline.\nIf a pipeline is deleted, any blueprints created for that pipeline will also be deleted.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/pipelines/articles/multiple-sales-pipeline\nKanban view\nDeals in a Kanban view can be filtered based on the layout and pipeline.\nMigrating data\nWhen you migrate from another CRM, the Pipeline field will be available during field mapping. The deals will be\nassigned to the layout's pipeline based on this field.\nIf the deals that to be migrated do not have a pipeline associated with them, they will be associated with the\ndefault pipeline in the selected layout.\nNote\nLayouts, pipelines, and stages are dependent on each other, so you should expect records to be\nskipped in the following situations:\nLayout-pipeline mismatch: While importing, you need to specify the layout the records will be\nimported to. If the deal's pipeline does not belong to the selected layout, the record will be skipped\ndue to the layout-pipeline mismatch.\nPipeline-stage mismatch: If the deal's pipeline belongs to the selected layout, the system will check\nthe stage selected for the record. If the stage value is not part of the deal's pipeline, the record will\nbe skipped due to the mismatch.\nIn the import history, you can check the records which were skipped and the reasons why.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/pipelines/articles/multiple-sales-pipeline\nDeleting a sales pipeline\nTo delete a sales pipeline\n1. Go to\u00a0Setup\u00a0>\u00a0Customization\u00a0>\u00a0Pipelines.\n2. Hover over the ellipsis and click\u00a0Delete.\nIf there are records associated with that pipeline, you have to transfer them to another pipeline before you can\ndelete it.\n3. Select the pipeline you are transferring the data to.\n4. Map the stages from the old pipeline to the new pipeline.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/pipelines/articles/multiple-sales-pipeline\n5. Click\u00a0Transfer and Delete.\nDeals that are already closed will be kept in the deleted pipeline and will not be transferred to a\ndifferent one.\nWhen a layout is deleted, you can choose the layout to move the records to. If the layout the\nrecords are being transferred to has a pipeline, then you can choose the pipeline and the stage the\nrecords from the deleted layout will be transferred to.\nClosed deals from the deleted layout will be transferred to the default pipeline of the new layout.\nIf a record is locked due to an approval process or review process in the Pipeline or Stage field, it\nwill not be transferred to another pipeline when its pipeline or layout is deleted.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/pipelines/articles/multiple-sales-pipeline\nTroubleshooting Tips\nCheck out our troubleshooting tips on Pipelines\n", "source": "multiple-sales-pipeline.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "territory-decision-management", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/territory-management/articles/territory-decision-management\nZoho Corporation\nDecision Guide for Territory Management\nAssumptions\nThis document assumes that you are already aware of the basic concepts of territory management. For an\nunderstanding of the feature in Zoho CRM, take a look at the help document -\u00a0Territory Management Overview.\nIntroduction\nTerritory Management is a system by which customer accounts are grouped based on a defined set of criteria. This\nmakes for easy sharing of customer accounts among sales teams in your company. In Zoho CRM, the territory\nmanagement feature lets you:\nCreate territories and specify criteria that defines a territory.\nBuild a territory hierarchy in addition to the role hierarchy in your account.\nAccess predefined reports on territories, such as, Star performers across territories, Overall Sales Cycle\nDuration among territories, Revenue By Territories, etc.\nCreate custom reports on territories.\nSet multiple forecast targets for users belonging to multiple territories.\nTerritory management need not be a requirement for every organization. You need to decide on the usage of\nterritories for your organization's sales structure and data-sharing model. This document will guide you and help\nyou decide if Territory Management is required for your company.\nRole vs Territory\n\u00a0Let us first take a look at the advantages that territory management has to provide, when compared to\nroles.\nRole Hierarchy\nTerritory Hierarchy\nRecord ownership is with one owner.\nRecord ownership is with one owner.\nRecord is accessible to:\nOwner of the record\nUsers who are superior to the record owner in\nthe role hierarchy\nRecord is accessible to:\nOwner of the record\nUsers who are superior to the record owner in the\nrole hierarchy\nOther users in the record's territory\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/territory-management/articles/territory-decision-management\nUsers who have access granted based on the\ndata sharing rules.\nUsers in the territories that are superior to record's\nterritory.\nSegment customer accounts based on the record\nownership.\nSegment customer accounts based on the account\ncharacteristics.\nUser can be assigned to only one role.\nUser can be assigned to multiple territories.\nUser can have a single forecast target only.\nUsers can have multiple forecasts targets, one for each\nterritory that they belong.\nHere is a business scenario to explain better!\nLet us assume that the sales force\u00a0in Zillum Inc. comprises of six teams across the United States - North Central,\nNorth East, North West, South Central, South East and South West. In this sales structure,\nYou do not want the sales team from any specific region to access the records of another region.\nThere may be a few important prospects that you want to share with the senior sales reps from two different\nteams, in two regions.\nIt may become a complicated process to achieve this using\u00a0roles\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0data sharing rules\u00a0\u00a0alone. On the other hand,\nwith territories based on a defined set of criteria, you can extend the Zoho CRM data-sharing model in your Zoho\nCRM account and easily share records with various users in different teams. This will ensure that the teams are\nfocused towards a goal to achieve the sales target set under the different times zones.\nBefore You Move to Territory Hierarchy\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/territory-management/articles/territory-decision-management\nBefore you plan to set up Territory Management in your Zoho CRM account, consider the following topics that\nwill help you determine if Territory Management is suited to your organization.\nSales Structure and Sharing Needs\u00a0- A CRM data sharing structure, which requires individuals belonging\nto multiple territories to access multiple customer accounts.\nForecasting\u00a0- Forecasts based on territory hierarchy. The need to set forecasts targets for each territory a\nusers belongs.\nAdministration\u00a0- Territories can be managed as individual units to reduce the burden on the administrators.\nSales Structure and Sharing Needs\nHow is your data shared with other users? It is crucial to analyze if the role-based hierarchy, data sharing rules,\ngroups and assignment rules provide the best options to share accounts as per your sale structure. Your\norganization may have the need to share records based on the products or services, revenue, zip code/region, or\nindustry, and not based on the record ownership. For such a complex and collaborative sharing model, you need\nterritories that ensure effective grouping of customer accounts and sharing records with different sales teams.\nDoes the sales structure in your organization require you to share customer accounts with many people from\ndifferent teams? Take this as an example: You have a ground sales representative who makes calls to the prospect\nand arranges for a meeting. You also have a field sales representative to visit the prospect for a demo of the\nproduct. How do you share accounts with both these sales reps?\nAn organization's sales structure may either be linear or a complex matrix, where data sharing is one to many.\nTerritory Management will be right for your organization, if \u2013\nYour company's sharing needs depend more on account's characteristics rather than the individual\nownership of the records.\nYour organization has a matrix sales structure, which requires individuals belonging to multiple territories\nto access multiple customer accounts.\nForecasting\nWhen you switch to Territory Management in Zoho CRM, forecasts will\nalso change to suit the territory requirements. When a user is part of\nmultiple territories you may need to set different sales targets for the user,\nas you will have different targets set for each territory.\nHaving a single forecast target for the user will not work then. By splitting\nyour monthly/quarterly targets based on the territories and the customer\naccounts in them, you will have a clear picture of the\u00a0sales forecast and the\ntarget to be achieved.\nAdministration\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/territory-management/articles/territory-decision-management\nDoes your administrator find it complicated to manage the numerous sharing rules that have to be monitored when\nthere are changes in the sales structure? When there is a complex data sharing architecture, some of the challenges\nthat you have to be aware of\u00a0 are:\nProviding similar data access to multiple users, managing those permissions individually or on a role level for\nusers, creating multiple sharing rules, maintaining huge data volume and monitoring frequent movement of sales\nreps to different sales groups.\nTerritories, on the other hand, are easier to manage. For example: Your sales structure is demarcated based on\nregion. A sales executive who takes care of customer enquires that come from China is a star performer in your\nteam. You decide to give this sales rep additional responsibility, to handle customers from Japan. In this example,\nterritory management gives you the flexibility to add the user in China and Japan sales territory to where the sales\nexecutive can access the customer records from both the countries.\nWhen complex data sharing rules and role hierarchy do not meet the requirements, territories are a much easier\noption to maintain as individual units that will also reduce the burden on the administrators. Visualizing your\norganization's sales structure in a territorial hierarchy can help decide if Territory Management is the option for\nyou.\nReasons to Use Territory Management!\nDo you need to avoid uneven distribution of the customer accounts to enhance focused sales and team\nresponsibilities?\nYour sales reps may either have too much work or too little work.\nThis could potentially lead to wasted resources and lost revenue.\nThe workload needs to be properly distributed to give your existing\ncustomers and prospects the attention that they need.\nSay your customer account segmentation range from small\nbusinesses to large corporations and the opportunities are handled\nby the sales people based on the deal size. In such a structure, use\nterritories to divide your sales team and assign prospects by\nbusiness size to gain flexibility over data visibility and sharing.\nOne group of sales reps can handle deals with maximum 50\nlicenses, another group can be assigned to deals with 50 plus\nlicenses. In case of dynamic sales teams, having territories also\nfacilitates easy movement of sales reps, as they may need to switch\nbetween territories.\nDoes your organization's business and data sharing model depend more on account's\u00a0characteristics\n(geographical divisions, customer account's size, multiple products lines, industry, etc.) and less on the\nindividual ownership?\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/territory-management/articles/territory-decision-management\nUsing territorial hierarchy is a big advantage as territories provide more flexibility over data visibility and sharing.\nLet's say you sell furniture for schools in different districts. Each sales group takes care of sales in their respective\nschool districts. Within each district there are numerous schools (pre schools, high schools, college) that would\nlike to buy furniture. Depending on the district and the quantity of order placed, you assign the deal to your sales\nreps. Here, it's the account's characteristic of the account that decides the overall sales structure.\nUsing the territories here, will benefit you. It will provide focus and simplify the process of record sharing among\nindividuals of different teams.\nAre your customers spread across various geographical\nlocations? If so, do you want to reduce travel time and\nexpenses for your sales team?\nCreating territories based on geographical locations of the\nmarket, and strategically placing sales reps within their native\ncountry\u2019s sales territory can be of great advantage for the\nbusiness. This reduces the time on travel as business\nopportunities are centered in one demarcated area. Also, this will\nhelp your sales team overcome the cultural and language barriers\nthat different territories have.\nDoes your business structure provide cross-selling\nopportunities? If so, do you need a flexible data sharing\nsystem that helps cross-selling to promote both customer\nretention and revenue growth?\nWith a business that deals in software for HR management, financing, staffing, and project management you may\nhave a sales group focused on each of these products. When a prospect is interested in two of these products, how\ndo you share the customer account with individuals from different teams who are involved in the sales cycle!\nHaving a territorial hierarchy based on the product lines and granting access to sales reps from multiple teams is\nan efficient way to manage this scenario. It helps in collaborative cross selling for your business.\nWould you look for industry expertise in your sale reps, if\u00a0your company deals with multiple product lines\nand verticals?\nSales reps need a thorough product/service knowledge and expertise that help boost sales. In travel business, if\nyou are in charge of a Caribbean cruise, you have to be familiar with the tour packages, the pricing, itinerary, ship\ninformation, its special features, excursions and so on.\nCreate a territory that includes customer accounts interested in the Caribbean cruise. Belonging to this territory\nthat gives you enough experience and opportunities to develop your proficiency and negotiating skills is definitely\ngood for sales.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/territory-management/articles/territory-decision-management\nYour Decision\nMake sure you choose the right data-sharing model for the\nsmooth running of your business.\u00a0If you would like to find\nout how Territory Management will suit your business needs,\nyou can also refer to the online help for more details on how\nit works.\nTo conclude. use territory management if you:\nHave a complex sales structure with the need to often change users to different sales teams/territories.\nNeed to segment customer accounts based on the account characteristics rather than the record ownership.\nWant an easy to maintain process for the administrators to manage sharing of data among multiple users of\ndifferent teams.\nRequire multiple forecasts targets for users belonging to different sales territories.\nSee Also\nTerritory Management - An Overview\nUsing Territories\nAssigning Territories\nForecasts based on Territory Hierarchy\n", "source": "territory-decision-management.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "exceptions", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/validation-rules/articles/exceptions\nZoho Corporation\nPoints to note while updating a field used in a\nvalidation rule.\nValidation Rules\u00a0are effective on creating a record manually. However, when fields used in a validation\nrule\u00a0(whether primary or secondary) are updated through other ways such as workflow update, and APIs, the field\nupdate takes precendence over the validation rules.\nThese instances are explained with further examples below:\nUpdating a primary field using a validation rule\nExample:\nSay you have a validation rule for the\u00a0Deals\u00a0module that says,\n<<If\u00a0Discount is > 20%,\u00a0throw an error,\u00a0\"Sorry! This is an unacceptable discount.\">>\nThis validation rule will be effective when you manually create a deal in CRM with a discount greater than 20%.\nHowever if the primary field,\u00a0Discount, is updated via any of the following means, the field update overrides the\nvalidation rule.\nThat is, if the discount field is updated as 25% via a workflow field update, this workflow takes precendence, and\nas a consequence, the value will be accepted by the system despite the validation rule that is supposed to throw an\nerror for values more than 25%.\nFollowing are the means for field update that will take precedence over the validation rule.\nMeans of field update in\nCRM\nField update details\nImport\nUpdated on importing new leads or overwriting existing\nrecords\nWorkflow rules\nUpdated as a result of workflow action\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/validation-rules/articles/exceptions\nApproval Process\nUpdated on approval or rejection of a record\nBlueprint\nUpdated as a result of the After Transition settings.\nWhen you create a validation rule as well as Blueprint\nvalidation for the same field, and if the two conditions are\ndifferent, Blueprint overrides the validation rule.\nThat is, as long as the field is within a process, the\nBlueprint validation is applicable. When a record has exited\na process, the validation rule is effective.\nAPIs\nUpdated via\u00a0API updateRecords\u00a0method\nMass update\nPrimary field used in a validation rule will not be available\nfor mass update.\nUpdating a secondary field using a validation rule\nThis is an important note. When you try to update any of the secondary fields used in a validation rule through\nworkflows, mass update, APIs or Import, CRM will accept the secondary field's values regardless of the\nconditions in the rule. As a result your data may gather unacceptable values despite the validation rule.\nFor example, you have a validation rule to define discounts based on region.\nDiscount cannot be greater than 20% for USA\nDiscount cannot be greater than 25% for UK\nDiscount cannot be greater than 15% for India\nIn this case,\u00a0Discount\u00a0is your primary field and the\u00a0Regions\u00a0become the secondary fields.\nWhile\u00a0Discount\u00a0may not even show up on a mass update,\u00a0Region\u00a0will. If you decide to update all Regions to\nIndia, all your deals may end up with different discounts for \"India\", while your validation rule prescribes things\ndifferently - thus leading to unacceptable values in your module.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/validation-rules/articles/exceptions\nCRM will currently not restrict the field update of secondary fields used in a validation rule.

To authenticate the emails, they must verify the\nfollowing authentication standards:\nDomain Verification\nDKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)\nSPF (Sender Policy Framework)\nAfter completing the authentication process in Zoho CRM, the next step is to add the automatically generated SPF\nand DKIM records to the domain manager.\u00a0Read more about authenticating emails.\u00a0\nDKIM authentication\nDomain Keys or DKIM is an email authentication system created by Yahoo! to verify the authenticity of an email\nsender and protect the message from being altered during transmission. It is based on the DomainKeys\nspecification, which combines elements of Identified Internet Mail to create a more secure protocol known as\nDomain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM). This protocol allows the sender to digitally sign each email message with a\ncryptographic signature, which is then verified by the recipient's email server. This ensures that the message has\nnot been tampered with or altered in any way. DKIM also helps to prevent spam and phishing attempts by\nverifying the sender's identity and domain.\nSPF authentication\nSPF, or Sender Policy Framework, is an email authentication protocol that allows domain owners to specify which\nservers are authorized to send emails on their behalf. It works by verifying the IP address of the sender against a\nlist of authorized IP addresses, known as an SPF record, that is published in the Domain Name System (DNS). If\nthe IP address of the sender is not on the list, then the email is rejected. This helps to protect against email\nspoofing and phishing attacks, as it ensures that only authorized email servers can send emails from a domain.\nConfiguring settings in your domain managers\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-configuration/articles/adding-spf-and-dkim-records-to-dns-settings\nGoDaddy\u00a0\nTo add the SPF record for your domain:\n1.

As a\nresult, the emails may end up as Spam in the recipient servers. We recommend not to add a new\nrecord if you already have one.\nSometimes, DNS providers will automatically add your domain name to the end of your DNS\nrecord's attribute name. For instance, if you set up a record with the attribute\nname\u00a0_domainkey.yourdomain.com, it might be changed\nto\u00a0_domainkey.yourdomain.com.yourdomain.com\u00a0due to this automatic addition.\u00a0To prevent this\nunintended repetition, simply place a dot at the end of the domain name when entering the DNS\nrecord. This dot indicates to the DNS provider not to add the domain name again to the record.\nFor example,\u00a01522406527143_domainkey.newgensaas.com, it might be changed\nto\u00a01522406527143_domainkey.newgensaas.com.newgensaas.com\u00a0\n", "source": "adding-spf-and-dkim-records-to-dns-settings.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "get-started-secure-crm-account", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/configure-allowed-ips/articles/get-started-secure-crm-account\nZoho Corporation\nSecure your CRM Account\nWhen you're handling\u00a0important information like customer data, company's annual revenue, stakeholder's details\nand the like you must take preventive measures to secure your accounts from unauthorized access.

Similarly, starting from February 2024, Gmail and Yahoo have established new guidelines to be\nfollowed by those who send 5000 or more emails daily to recipients who have Gmail or Yahoo accounts.\nTheir\u00a0sender policy establishes the need for authentication of emailing domains, prevention of sending\nunwarranted or unsolicited emails, and ensuring recipients can easily unsubscribe from all emails. It is important\nto note that what were previously considered recommendations before are now mandated by these providers for\nbetter email delivery.\nLet's look at each point in brief for a better understanding. We ask that you follow all these guidelines to have\nbetter email delivery for your organization and to protect your email-sending practices from potential risks. Your\nactions will also help us maintain a better email infrastructure that is shared among all Zoho CRM customers.\nEmail Authentication\nGmail and Yahoo now require authentication of your email-sending domains by one or more authentication\nmethods, depending on how many emails you send per day. If emails are sent from domains that are not\nauthenticated, they may bounce with a 5.7.26 error for Google and 5XX for Yahoo, or be marked as spam.\nAction to be taken by all email senders:\n1. Authenticate your domain via DKIM\nAll email senders are required to ensure authentication of their email-sending domains with DKIM records\navailable within Zoho CRM. This is a mandatory step to use your organization's custom domains to send\nemails. If your domains are not authenticated, all emails sent from Zoho CRM will automatically have their\nNote: This document contains a combination of guidelines that apply to all email senders and to\n'bulk senders' as classified by Google and Yahoo. A bulk sender is defined as an organization that\nsends more than 5000 emails per day to recipients with Gmail and Yahoo email addresses through all of\ntheir organization's emailing platforms.\u00a0Since your organization can be classified as a bulk sender even if\nyou are sending less than 5000 emails via Zoho CRM, owing to emails sent by your organization from\nother emailing platforms, Zoho CRM recommends that all email senders implement the guidelines\nexpected from bulk senders.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-tips-guidelines/articles/google-and-yahoo-s-2024-guidelines-for\n-email-security-and-delivery\nFROM: address replaced by Zoho's own authenticated domains.\n2. Set DMARC policy and alignment for your domain\nDMARC (Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) is built as a combination\nof the DKIM and SPF standards with additional features like reporting, policy definition, and the notion of\nidentity alignment. A DMARC policy helps the email servers and systems used by your recipients decide\nwhat actions to take for emails from your domain that don\u2019t pass SPF or DKIM, protecting your domain\nfrom bad actors and phishing attempts that try to make use of your domain to send emails.\nSince Zoho CRM requires your organization's email-sending domains to be authenticated by adding DKIM\nrecords, your domain will meet the expected DMARC standard if your organization is not a bulk sender,\nonce you complete DKIM authentication. No additional steps are required in this case. However, in the\ninterest of protecting your organization from future risks, we recommend that you complete the DMARC\nsteps as recommended for bulk senders, in further sections of this document.\nAction to be taken by all bulk email senders:\n1. Authenticate all email-sending domains with both DKIM and SPF records\nFor added protection and to comply with requirements set by Google and Yahoo, all bulk senders are\nexpected to authenticate their email-sending domains using both SPF and DKIM records.\n2. Publish a valid DMARC policy\nAll bulk email senders must set up a DMARC policy. To pass DMARC authentication, your domains must\nfirst be authenticated via DKIM and SPF. Your organization will pass this requirement as long as you follow\nthe previous steps mentioned in this document.\nWhen publishing a DMARC policy, all bulk senders are expected to publish a policy with at least 'p=none'\nso that emails do not land in spam.\nThere are other types of DMARC policies you can choose to set if you are looking for specific outcomes\nthat come with those types of policies. These types are as follows:\n'p=quarantine' - Your recipient's email systems will mark the incoming message as spam and send it\nto the recipient's spam folder. The email will still be delivered, but will not be available in the inbox\nfolder of your recipient.\n'p=reject' - The incoming email will be completely rejected by your recipient's email systems and\nwill not be delivered.\nAfter configuring DMARC, you have the choice to enable BIMI, which allows you to include your\nbrand logo in emails sent from your domain.\u00a0\nNote: It is important that you ensure you have authenticated all your domains via SPF and\nDKIM before choosing to implement a quarantine or reject the DMARC policy. This is\nneeded to avoid instances where your own DMARC policy completely stops your\norganization from sending outgoing emails via certain systems or domains.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-tips-guidelines/articles/google-and-yahoo-s-2024-guidelines-for\n-email-security-and-delivery\nAvoid using public email addresses from providers like Gmail and\nYahoo to send emails via Zoho CRM\nWhen sending emails from within CRM, especially when sending any promotional emails, it is essential to send\nthem using 'from addresses' that are connected to your email-sending domain instead of using free email\naddresses. Using public addresses to send emails from Zoho CRM may result in email delivery issues due to\nGmail's implementation of a DMARC quarantine enforcement policy. It is important to mention that Yahoo\nalready has a similar policy in place. Zoho CRM currently does not allow the sending of mass emails using\nYahoo's From headers via Zoho CRM, and this restriction will soon also be applied to Gmail addresses too. The\nbest way to send mass emails through Zoho CRM is by using custom email-sending domains.\nOne-click unsubscribe\nIt is expected that our customers primarily use Zoho CRM to send transactional emails. That being said, if you are\nsending any sales emails for promotional activities, it is recommended to allow your recipients to easily\nunsubscribe from your emails. The unsubscribe option should be clearly visible within the email and should be\ncompleted with just one click.\nA 'List Unsubscribe' header will automatically be added to all mass emails and any email template that contains an\nunsubscribe link when the template is sent using any of Zoho CRM's email sending functionalities. This ensures\nthat all promotional emails sent from Zoho CRM accounts comply with RFC standards.\nProviding an easy opt-out option will decrease spam complaints against your email-sending domain.\nNotes:\nTo learn more on how to authenticate your email-sending domains in Zoho CRM, click here.\nFor setting up and publishing the DMARC policy, click here.\nThis step is needed for all types of email senders, including bulk senders.\nThis step is expected from organizations who are bulk senders, but we recommend all senders make use\nof Zoho CRM's unsubscribe link and email opt-out features to set this up.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-tips-guidelines/articles/google-and-yahoo-s-2024-guidelines-for\n-email-security-and-delivery\nEnsure sending only relevant emails\nEmail providers require all senders to maintain a spam rate below 0.1%, and to never exceed 0.3% in any\ncircumstance. Exceeding these limits will put your organization at risk of being completely blocked from sending\nemails.\nHow your emails are perceived by your recipients is important. This will largely be based on the content that you\nsend. Improperly formatted and composed emails are more likely to be marked as spam by email providers. It is\nimportant to avoid using open-ended tags in your emails. Sales teams should be cautious about using malicious or\noverly short URLs, as this can lead to emails being flagged as spam. Urgent or spam-like language should be\navoided in email content, even when aiming for conversions. It is crucial to maintain high standards for email\ncontent to improve deliverability rates and refine the mailing list to engage with interested recipients.\nZoho CRM provides your organization with an email credibility dashboard for the administrators to\nmonitor their organization's email performance and periodically keep track of the email bounce and spam\ncomplaint rate. Learn more.\nThis step is needed for all types of email senders, including bulk senders.\nAlthough following all of the above guidelines seems challenging, we are here to help and guide you\nthrough the entire process.

In addition to this, you can also see the changes in the related fields and its values with respect to a\nrecord's transition to different stages.\nLets take a few examples to understand this further.\u00a0\nScenario 1.\u00a0The sales manager wants to pinpoint the stage in the lead conversion process that shows a major\nstagnation. So, he tracks the \"lead status\" picklist field to find out the amount of time a lead spends at a particular\nstage. The tracking showed that the lead was held at \"not contacted\" stage for 15 days before moving to\n\"contacted\". It was easier to track this update since every transition of \"lead status\" was recorded.\u00a0\nScenario 2.\u00a0The sales manager wants to track the variation in the total amount that is quoted for every Quote\nstage. So, he enables tracking in \"Quote stages\" and chooses \"Amount\" as the related field of a record.\u00a0\nScenario 3.\u00a0The sales manager wants to get the list of deals which have moved to closed lost stage from\nnegotiation stage. He can create a report with stage history module by choosing Stage Field as Negotiation and\nMoved To field as Closed lost.\nIf the customer wants to get the list of deals which has moved to In Progress stage from Requirements gathering\nstage with duration greater than 4 days.\nAvailability\nEnable picklist history tracking\nYou can enable tracking for one picklist field per module. The history tracking for the mentioned field will be\nenabled across all the layouts. In the\u00a0Picklist History\u00a0related list,\u00a0we will display 5 default fields namely picklist\nPermission Required\nUsers with Module Customization permission can enable picklist history tracking.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/picklist-history\nvalues, duration, modified time, modified by, and moved to. Aside from this, you can include 10 additional\nfields.\nTo enable history tracking\n1. Log in to your Zoho CRM account.\n2.

Customers often\nre-request the same service every so often, for example, a customer may revisit the salon to take advantage of a\nnew offer you have or you may receive a home cleaning request from a client every holiday season.\nGiven the likelihood of repeat customers, maintaining a common database to store customer's details like their\naddresses, past services, membership details, appointments, and the services they select will be a great help to\nemployees so they are fully informed when a customer calls for a repeat appointment.\nPreparing a service catalog will help employees handle service-related enquiries. They can quickly browse\nthrough the list of available and unavailable services, and refer to notes and other details of the customer when\nanswering their queries.\u00a0\nThe Services module in Zoho CRM allows companies to create a database of the services they provide along with\nthe following important details:\u00a0\n1.

Based on the service location that is configured, the appointment is scheduled at either\nthe business address or client's address.\n4. Service availability: The days and times when the service is available. You can also select a date range for\nservices that are available for a limited period. The service time and day must be within the business hours\nset in your CRM account.\n5. Price: The cost and tax details of a service.\n6.

The system will\nidentify columns that match the CRM fields and map them automatically.\n15. Hover over the field and enter the field values in the Replace Empty Values text box. Sometimes the field\nin an import file doesn't have a value, in case that field is marked mandatory in CRM, the record will not be\nimported because of absence of value. To avoid such situations, you can mention an alternate value that will\nreplace the empty field. For example, you have mapped the Last Name field from the file with the Last\nName field in the Leads module, which is mandatory. So without the field value, the record will be skipped\nduring the import process. To avoid that, you can specify the value that should replace the empty Last\nName field.\n16. Hover over the field and click the Add (+) icon next to the field name and map multiple fields in CRM with\na single field from the file. For example, if the Billing Address and the Shipping Address are same you can\nmap both these CRM fields to the appropriate fields from the file.\n17. Click the Assign Default Values tab and select the CRM Fields with the appropriate Default field values.\nOnce the values are specified, all the records will have the field value that you have specified by default.\nFor example, you are importing a set of records to the Leads module and the Lead Source is common for\nall the records. The appropriate value for the lead source can be chosen here so that all the records will have\nthe specified field value by default.\n18. Click Save and Next.\n19.

Normally, you would have to create\nand maintain a copy of this set of values separately for each picklist.\nUsing global sets, however, you can create and maintain a single set of values and associate it with as many\npicklists as you want.\nWhat are global sets?\nGlobal sets are collections of picklist values that can be associated with multiple picklists across modules:\nThey are collections because you can't link parts of a global set with a picklist; you can only link the entire\nset of picklist values.\nThey are associated with one or more picklists. This means that changes made in a global set will be\nreflected in all associated picklists.\nBenefits of using global sets include the following:\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/overview-of-global-sets\nEliminate the need to repeatedly enter a common set of picklist values when creating multiple picklists.\nSimplify the process of adding, updating, and deleting picklist values that need to be consistent across\nmultiple picklists.\nSome useful built-in aspects are as follows:\nChanging a global set value automatically updates that value in existing records, workflow rules, field\nupdates, reports, etc.\nFlexibility to switch the association of a picklist from local to global set and vice versa.\nMapping values when switching from local to global set. This includes the following:\nAutomatic mapping of values that are present in both the local picklist and the global set.\nManual mapping of values that are present in a local picklist but absent in the global set. You can map\nthese values to existing values in the global set.\nAvailability\nWhen should global sets be used?\nUse the criteria below to determine whether you should use global sets in a given scenario:\nIf the picklist values are specific to one module, local picklist values would be the more effective option.\nFor example, picklist values like Invalid number , Number is busy , and Requested call back are\nspecific to the Calls module. In this case, add them as local picklist values.\nIf the picklist values are needed across modules, a global set would be the ideal option.\nFor example, sources of leads are often used across Leads, Contacts, and Deals modules. In this case,\ncreate a global set with lead sources as picklist values, then associate this global set with picklists\nacross those modules.\nScenario\nYour business caters to a wide range of industries. Teams across your organization look at industry categories as a\nmeans to understand the needs of your customers better. Accordingly, picklists with industry types as values are\npresent in multiple modules. These values are stored in multiple records and used in workflow rules, reports, and\nso on.\nUsers with the Modules Customization permission enabled in their profile can use global sets.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/overview-of-global-sets\nMaintaining such picklists is a time-consuming process:\n1. Each time these values are needed in a new picklist, you have to manually enter a large number of them.\n2. In response to internal and external changes, you may need to update these values frequently. Recently, you\nhad to split the \"Govt/Military\" category into two smaller categories: \"Government\" and \"Military\". To do\nthis, you had to make the changes by hand in every relevant picklist.\nThis process is undesirable for two reasons:\n1. It's inefficient. You're repeating the same set of steps in multiple locations.\n2. It's error-prone. Since you're making the changes by hand in multiple locations, you may forget to add or\nremove a value in one or many picklists, you may enter different spellings in different places, or you may\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/overview-of-global-sets\ncommit other possible errors.\nUsing global sets, this process is simpler, faster, and more accurate:\n1. Create a global set with industries as values.\n2. Simply associate multiple picklists with this global set instead of manually typing in values for separate\nlocal picklists.\n3. Update a value in the global set and it will be reflected in all the associated picklists and other places in the\nCRM.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/customizing-fields/articles/overview-of-global-sets\nThis is more efficient and less error-prone than the process required for local picklist values. These advantages\npersist in other scenarios where the same set of picklist values are used in multiple picklists.\nIf you want to use global sets in your CRM system, see Working with global sets.\n", "source": "overview-of-global-sets.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "kiosk-an-overview", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/kiosk/articles/kiosk-an-overview\nZoho Corporation\nKiosk Studio - An overview\nKiosk Studio is a no-code customization tool in Zoho CRM. It allows admins to simplify work for their users,\ncustomers, and vendors by creating and embedding custom functionalities (called kiosks) across the CRM.\nThe problem\nA brand new CRM comes with a set of standard modules and configurations. This default setup serves as a great\nstarting point for most organizations. However, every organization has its own way of modeling customer\nrelationships and doing customer-related work. To get the maximum value from Zoho CRM, admins can make\nchanges to the standard setup by configuring custom modules, custom fields, multiple pipelines, canvas pages,\nwizards, translations, and more. Customizing the CRM in this way is something most admins are familiar with.\nWhen it comes to customizing the CRM by adding capabilities to it, the story is different. In these cases, admins\nhave to invest a lot of development effort and time to meet their needs. This acts as a barrier to admins and slows\ndown the process of boosting the power of the CRM to their users, customers, vendors, and other stakeholders. It\nalso slows down the process of making changes to the added capabilities.\nOur solution\nAdmins can quickly create custom capabilities (called kiosks) and make them available for all CRM users. They\ncan do this by using Kiosk Studio, a no-code interface that allows users to build capabilities by using some basic\nbuilding elements.\nThe ease of building a kiosk does not mean there is a trade-off in power. In fact, a kiosk can bring in data from all\nmodules in the CRM, have custom screens with fields not available in the CRM, perform actions for records\nacross the CRM, fire webhooks, and execute custom functions. Once built, kiosks can be hosted in multiple places\nacross the CRM. This gives admins a lot of options when it comes to sharing these capabilities with anyone\nrelated to an organization.\nHere's a quick overview of Kiosk Studio:\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/kiosk/articles/kiosk-an-overview\nUse cases\nSome use cases include:\nA kiosk to quickly send vouchers to a bank's customers.\nA car dealer added a kiosk to their CRM's homepage to add a lead and book a test drive in one shot.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/kiosk/articles/kiosk-an-overview\nThis kiosk brings in all relevant data from the CRM to make insurance policy renewal easier.\nAn education consultancy's CRM has a kiosk to fill out a single application, leaving the CRM to take care\nof creating records across modules, sending emails, and so on.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/kiosk/articles/kiosk-an-overview\nA kiosk for sales development representatives to get their post-call actions done.\nA kiosk full of useful capabilities for CRM admins.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/kiosk/articles/kiosk-an-overview\nA sales playbook kiosk providing tailored guidance to sales representatives.\nTo learn more about kiosks, please see:\nElements of a kiosk\nWorking with Kiosk Studio\n", "source": "kiosk-an-overview.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "create-groups", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/group-management/articles/create-groups\nZoho Corporation\nCreate and Manage Groups\nIn Zoho CRM, you can create different types of groups (set of users) to manage a set of common records.

Our goal is to educate you on the importance of BIMI in enhancing your email communication. This guide\nwill walk you through the intricacies of BIMI and its associated protocols, its necessity, and a step-by-step\nprocedure for its implementation.\u00a0\u00a0\nImprove brand visibility in emails through BIMI\u00a0\nEmail remains the most effective method of communication, boasting the highest open and click-through rates in\nthe industry. Given its powerful impact, it's crucial for your brand's emails to be immediately recognizable and\ntrustworthy. This is achieved through the BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) standard.\nConsider the two email examples provided below. The email on the left comes from a BIMI-authenticated sender,\nwhile the one on the right does not have this authentication. Notice the presence of the brand's logo as the sender's\ncontact picture and a blue checkmark next to the sender\u2019s name in the authenticated email.\nIn today's environment, filled with spam and phishing attempts, it's vital for businesses to distinguish their emails\nfrom malicious ones. This distinction not only helps protect customers from potential scams but also enhances\nbrand identity and recall. Moreover, using BIMI increases the likelihood that emails from verified senders will\nsuccessfully reach their audience.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-tips-guidelines/articles/bimi-for\n-email-authentication\nWhat is BIMI?\u00a0\nBIMI, which stands for Brand Indicators for Message Identification, is an email authentication protocol aimed at\nboosting brand visibility and credibility during email exchanges. This standard enables email applications to\nverify if an email comes from a legitimate sender and whether the content remains unaltered during transmission.\nIf the sender is authenticated and the email is intact, BIMI allows the display of the brand's trademark logo as the\nsender\u2019s contact picture and includes a verification mark (such as a blue tick) alongside the email. This informs\nthe recipient that the email is from a trustworthy and verified source.\nBIMI operates in conjunction with DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and\nConformance) authentication, which allows domain owners to instruct receiving email servers on how to handle\nemails that fail authentication tests and may be falsely using their domain. A DMARC record is essential before\nimplementing BIMI. As the pinnacle of current email authentication protocols, BIMI ensures that emails from\nlegitimate senders are secure against impersonation and tampering by malicious actors.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-tips-guidelines/articles/bimi-for\n-email-authentication\nWhy is BIMI important for my organization?\u00a0\nBIMI holds significant relevance in the realm of email authentication due to several key reasons:\nHigh email volume: BIMI can help decrease email phishing attacks and spam that may harm\nyour organization's brand value if it sends numerous transaction emails to customers.\nDistinguishing Genuine Emails: One of the significant benefits of BIMI is its ability to help\nrecipients distinguish authentic emails from impersonation or phishing attempts. By displaying\nthe company's logo in emails, BIMI makes it easier for users to recognize genuine emails.\nEnhancing Brand Recognition and Trust: Displaying a company logo in emails can\nsignificantly boost brand recognition. It provides an immediate visual association with the\nbrand, enhancing the user's trust and confidence in the email's content.\nImprove Email Performance: With the added trust and recognition that comes with BIMI,\nrecipients are more likely to open and engage with the emails, potentially improve the email\nperformance.\u00a0\nHow Can I enable BIMI?\u00a0\nBIMI enablement is specific to each service provider. The requirement for each mail service provider varies\nregarding how they enable BIMI for the domains. It's a mix of both technical as well as usage requirement.\nHowever, there are a few elements that remain common across them.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-tips-guidelines/articles/bimi-for\n-email-authentication\nAn owned private domain that is SPF, DKIM and DMARC authenticated\nA trademarked logo of your brand in Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) SVG format\nVerified Mark Certificate (VMC)* for your logo\nVMCs are essential for businesses to display verified brand logos in email sender fields. They are issued by\npublicly trusted certification authorities and require the brand logo to be trademarked and DMARC compliant.\nClick here to see the list of BIMI supported email providers. Steps to enable an email service provider for some of\nthe major providers are as follows.\nSteps to enable BIMI\nDMARC is a pre-requisite for BIMI authentication\nDMARC policy should be set to reject for the domains and its sub-domains (p=reject; sp=reject)\nOr, quarantine to be set at 100% (p=quarantine; pct=100)\nThe logo (BIMI refers to this as an indicator file) for your brand should be converted to the SVG\nPortable/Secure format to be compatible with BIMI protocols.\nDepending on the mail service provider, they might mandate a VMC certificate (BIMI refers to this as the\nBIMI evidence document) to enable BIMI. VMC is a form of external validation stating that your indicator\nfile (logo, in this case) is valid. Providers such gmail, apple mail etc. mandates the use of VMC. However,\nproviders such as Yahoo!, AOL etc. do not mandate and treats VMC as an optional validation.\nPublish the BIMI record to your domains domains DNS TXT record. A sample entry is as follows:\n\u201cv=BIMI1; l=https://full/path/to/logo/file.svg; a=https://full/path/to/evidence/document.pem\u201d\nNote: Apart from this, providers like Yahoo! monitor the sender reputation and activity to enable BIMI. BIMI\nprotocol is not supported by Outlook/Microsoft mailboxes\nPlease refer to this guide for more details regarding the requirements by specific mailbox provider.\nWhat BIMI means to Zoho CRM users\u00a0\nIf your organization sends a large volume of transactional emails to customers, adopting the BIMI protocol to\nauthenticate your domain is advisable. With BIMI, the email recipient will recognize your brand image,\nsignificantly reducing the likelihood of your emails being marked as spam or blocked compared to emails from\nnon-BIMI authenticated domains. For responsible email senders, this ensures better email deliverability, making it\nmore likely that your communications will reach the customer's inbox rather than the spam folder. Consequently,\norganizations that implement the BIMI protocol can expect to see an improvement in their Zoho CRM email\ncredibility score.\nBIMI not only enhances email security, but also boosts brand recognition and improves email deliverability. Its\nintegration with DMARC positions it as an essential tool for protecting email communications and refining sales\ncommunication strategies.\nFor more info, you can refer to the BIMI group webpage from here.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-tips-guidelines/articles/bimi-for\n-email-authentication\nCredibility Report: The Impact of BIMI\u00a0\nZoho CRM's Email Credibility Dashboard gives organizations a score between 1 and 100 to show how reliable\ntheir email habits are. If you get more than 70, that's seen as a good score. This number shows how much people\ncan trust and respect the organization based on how they handle their emails.\nImplementing BIMI can improve this score by ensuring that emails sent from the organization's domain are\nauthenticated and secure, thanks to the underlying DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting,\nand Conformance) protocol. By displaying a brand-controlled logo in supported email clients, BIMI not only\nenhances brand visibility, but also reassures recipients of the email's authenticity. This reinforcement of trust and\nauthenticity can lead to better engagement rates and a reduced risk of phishing, ultimately boosting the\norganization's email credibility score within Zoho CRM.\n \n", "source": "bimi-for-email-authentication.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "marketing-attribution", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/marketing-attribution/articles/marketing-attribution\nZoho Corporation\nMarketing Attribution\nWhy do Businesses Need Marketing Attribution?\nMarketing campaigns play a crucial role in any business, as they help one ensure a better consumer reach and\nawareness. Most companies prefer integrated campaigns since multiple channels ascertain much better and\nconsistent brand promotions. In general, sales and marketing cycles in any business are quite lengthy processes\nthat last for months and it's likely that the buyer interacts with the reps several times through multiple channels\nduring this period.\nIt's essential that you track and capture the touchpoints that help close the sale, understand if your campaigns are\nactually driving revenues and figure out the right campaign that actually moved the buyer down the decision path.\nThis is where the marketing attribution comes into play.\nAnalyze, understand, and measure your marketing campai\nAnalyze, understand, and measure your marketing campai\u2026\n \u200b\nBenefits of Marketing Attribution\nYour company launched a new product last month and it was marketed on several platforms like social media,\nbrochures were distributed to existing customers and partners, and display ads were put up to drive brand\nawareness. At the end, you notice an elevation in the overall conversion rate and a resultant increase in the\nrevenue, however, you are clueless as to which part of the campaign was responsible for these results? or Which\ncampaign should be credited for maximum lead generation?\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/marketing-attribution/articles/marketing-attribution\nMarketing attribution helps you gauge questions like these.\nIt helps you map the journey of your prospects\u00a0from lead to customer while taking every touchpoint and\ninteraction into account\u00a0along the way.\nGives you a proper understanding on which marketing channels are effective and which are not. You can\nsignificantly increase your marketing efforts and invest more on the channels that are getting the best returns.\nA detailed insight of this sort will give you a clear picture on help to attribute the revenue credit to the various\nmarketing channels based on their performance.\nAvailability\nSales Stages in Attribution Models\nSales stages in attribution models display the stages that are commonly involved in a sales funnel. The default\nstages that are available in Zoho CRM's attribution models are: Lead creation, Lead conversion, Deal creation and\nDeal won. You can also add more stages to an attribution model based on your business sales funnel. You can\nchoose and add stages only between the deal creation and deal won stages.\nTypes of Attribution Models in Zoho CRM\nZoho CRM offers six attribution models that give you better performance insights across your marketing\ncampaigns, optimize your budget, and let you credit the most deserved campaign. You can choose only one\nattribution model at any given point of time. In the following section we will discuss each model in detail and\nhelp you choose the best model for your business structure.\nFirst Touch\nThe First Touch model gives credit based on a single touchpoint, that is, it gives 100% of the credit or deal\namount to the marketing effort that brought a visitor to your website for the first time. This model basically\nemphasizes the marketing campaigns that are at the top of the funnel. This model best works when your focus is\nsolely on the lead generation and brand awareness.\nExample:\u00a0Say a customer signed up for a webinar after visiting your company's webpage, then participated in a\nsurvey sent through email, then converted at the end of the survey, and after a trade show the deals are closed. So,\nin this case, all the credit would be given to the first touchpoint - the webinar.\nPermission Required\nUsers with administrative permission in profile can configure attribution models.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/marketing-attribution/articles/marketing-attribution\nLast Touch\nThe Last Touch model is also a single touch model, that gives credit based on the single touch point. However,\nunlike the first touch model this model shifts all the credit to the final step in the sales cycle. It focuses on the last\nthing that triggered the winning of the deal while ignoring all the steps that were taken up until the deal won stage.\nIn other words, it gives 100% credit or deal amount to the campaign that was responsible for winning the deal. If\nyour primary campaign goal is to generate maximum revenue, the last-touch attribution model can be useful for\nyour business structure.\nExample:\u00a0Say you sent out an email campaign to your existing customers regarding a new ebook , you then send\nout surveys to the participants who showed interest by replying to the email campaign. At the end of the survey\nmost of the customers are converted and after a sales call you eventually leads to deal closure. So, in this case the\nlast touchpoint gets the 100% of the deal amount - the sales call.\nU Shape\nThe U shape attribution model gives credit to two key touchpoints - the first touch and the last touch and any\nmiddle touchpoints that lie between the two. The first touch which represents the lead generation or initial\ninteraction with any marketing activity is given 40% of the credit. Similarly, the last touchpoint or deal won is\ngiven another 40%. The remaining 20% is divided evenly across the middle touchpoints that occur between those\ntwo stage transitions. This model can be effective if the initial interaction with a lead is vital in your business and\nthe last touch is important because it is directly related to deal closure.\nExample:\u00a0Say, your business has an impressive conversion rate but maintaining an equivalent retention rate till the\nsale closure is quite challenging. In such cases, the campaigns that are run after the conversion till the sale is\nclosed and won holds more importance than lead generation. Thus, you can use the U shape attribution model and\nassign 40% of the revenue credit to the first touchpoint and another 40% to the last touchpoint and the remaining\n20% to the touchpoints that took place between these two stages.\nW Shape\nThe W shape attribution model is similar to U shaped, but this model includes an additional key touchpoint. The\nthree touchpoints: lead creation, deal creation and deal won receive 90% of the credit (30% to each touchpoint).\nThe remaining 10% of the credit is distributed among the middle touchpoints. The underlying concept of\nspreading the credit in this manner is to emphasize the three key funnel transitions that impact a customer's\njourney.\nExample:\u00a0If your sales cycle is longer it is more likely to be complex and include several revisits by the\ncustomers, more competitor evaluations, and multiple communication channels. To improve the accuracy of\nplanning and budget allocation it is incredibly important to understand all the touch points that lead customers to\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/marketing-attribution/articles/marketing-attribution\ninteract with brands and move further in the pipeline, estimate the length and the path trends of each campaign\nand impact of each campaign\u2019s across the funnel.\nLinear\nA linear attribution model divides the credit equally between each touchpoint. The first touch, last touch, and any\nintermediate events are all treated with the same importance. For example, if your sales journey involves 10\ntouchpoints, it will give 10% of the credit to each. This model gives a better and more comprehensive idea of the\nmiddle touchpoints which may be equally important in generating revenue as the first or the last touch. But, it\nmay appear to be an idealistic model as it gives equal importance to every touchpoint, which may not be the case -\nit is not possible that every touch truly contributed the same amount towards the sale. To address this, we let you\nchoose the credit weightage (on level of 1 to 4) for each campaign and also exclude the ones that you think did not\nhave much impact on the sale.\nExample:\u00a0Say, you conduct a webinar and also promote your product on Twitter and get more leads from Twitter\nthan webinar. You also observed that the conversion rate was better after the demo requests at the middle stage.\nThe requests received from the Google Ads were comparatively more than the email invitations. Based upon these\nfacts, you can ascribe more credit to the Twitter and Google Ads touches and invest more on these channels in\nfuture for better returns.\nTime Decay\nA time decay attribution model gives more credit to the recent marketing interaction. This model can work better\nfor longer sales cycle where the early touchpoints may not necessarily be the most important touchpoints. Like,\nonce the prospect is in the pipeline you focus more on nurturing initiatives that can incite a prospect to move\nfurther towards the sale - to an opportunity and revenue. So, instead of disproportionately allocating revenue\ncredit to the initial stages, the time decay model gives more credit to most recent touchpoints that moved the\nbuyer to the sale.\nExample:\u00a0Say, a buyer requests for a product demo right before the sale was closed. If he has also clicked on a\nblog post in your email a week before that, then based on the time decay model the credit weightage will be more\nfor the product demo than the blog post, even though the blog post may have driven him into the product demo or\nincited the deal closure.\nCustomizing Attribution Model\nThe U and the W shaped attribution models give you the freedom to build custom attribution model that best\nmatches the customer journey specific to your buying process. These models are more flexible and accurate as\nthey let you allocate the percentages of revenue credit to each touchpoint and meet your own reporting criteria.\nFor example, you know that one of your campaign that included a landing page at some middle stages played an\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/marketing-attribution/articles/marketing-attribution\nimportant role in pushing the customer down the funnel, you can go ahead and assign that stage a higher\npercentage of the credit - like 25%, 40%, 25% distribution. Zoho CRM allows you to do three levels of\ncustomization in these models:\nBy default the first, middle and last touchpoints for both the models is set at Lead creation, Deal creation and\nDeal Won. You can change these touchpoints based on which sales stage matters the most to your business\nstructure.\nYou can customize the credit percentages on each of these touchpoints by applying your own weighting if\nyou know which campaign had the highest impact or the one that was more responsible for pushing the\ncustomer down the sales funnel.\nYou can add more stages to your attribution model between Deals Creation to Deals Won stage if your\nbusiness involves a lengthy and complex sales cycle with multiple touchpoints until the eventual sales\nclosure.\nSetting up Attribution Model\nBased on your understanding of the different attribution models, your company's requirements and the touchpoints\nthat you want to capture, you can choose an appropriate model for your organization.\nTo set up an attribution model\n1. Go to\u00a0Setup\u00a0>\u00a0Customization\u00a0>\u00a0Marketing Attribution.\nYou will be redirected to the attribution models page.\nNote\nIf you are setting up the attribution model for the first time, Zoho CRM will calculate the ROI based on\nthe past two months of data.\nYou can choose only one attribution model at a given point of time.\nYou can add sales stages to the U and W shaped models only from the standard layout of the deals\nmodule.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/marketing-attribution/articles/marketing-attribution\n2.

You can\nspecify up to 10 primary conditions, such as \"Not between 0 and 15\" or \"Not between 0 and 10\".\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/validation-rules/articles/create-validation-rules\nYou can decide if the primary condition is checked for all records or for subsets of records. Each primary\ncondition can have up to five secondary conditions. For example, we can check whether the Discount\n(primary field) is less than 15% (primary condition) for deals from the NA and MEA regions (secondary\ncondition). We can have another secondary condition for deals in the EU region. This way, we can validate a\nfield differently based on values in other fields.\nEach secondary condition can have one error/alert message. This message content is customizable.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/validation-rules/articles/create-validation-rules\nMultiple error messages may be displayed for a field simultaneously because all primary conditions are\nchecked when the validation rule is executed.\nExecute rule on\nYou can decide when the validation rule should be executed. This is because you can define the criteria in two\nways:\nYou can set unwanted values in the primary condition(s) and specify that an alert should be triggered when\nthe condition is satisfied. For instance, you could define the condition as a discount value exceeding 15\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/validation-rules/articles/create-validation-rules\npercent (undesirable) and notify the user when the input value fulfills this condition.\nAlternatively, you can set desired values in the primary condition(s) and indicate that an alert should be\ntriggered if they are not satisfied. Specify the primary condition as a discount value below 15 percent\n(preferred) and notify the user if the input value doesn't meet this condition.\nTo create a validation rule\n1. Go to Setup > Customization > Modules and Fields.\n2. Select the module for which you want to create the validation rule.\n3. In the [Module] page, click the Validation Rules tab.\n4. Click Create New Validation Rule.\n5. In the Create Validation Rule pop-up, perform the following actions:\na. Select the layout that the field you wish to validate belongs to.\nb. Select the field to validate.\nc. Select the validation type as Based on Criteria.\nd. Select either Save Only or Field Verify and Save for Validate on.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/validation-rules/articles/create-validation-rules\ne. Click Next.\n6. In the Validation rule editor page, specify the primary condition to initiate the rule. For instance, if you\nwant to validate the discount field to keep out discounts more than 15%, your primary condition will be\n\"Discount > 15%\".\n7. Click Done.\n8. Select an Execute rule option from the dropdown list. In our example, we've defined the undesired value in\nthe primary condition, so we'll select When criteria is met.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/validation-rules/articles/create-validation-rules\n9. Customize the error message according to your needs. In our case, we want to forbid the entry of a\ndiscount value greater than 15% for certain regions, so our error message will be, \"You cannot provide a\ndiscount over 15% for deals from the NA and MEA regions.\"\n10. Configure the secondary condition. Set the other options like validation preference and error location if\navailable. If you want the error message to be displayed for all records, leave it as-is. If you want to apply it\nto a subset or create multiple conditions, you'll have to edit it. In our example, we want this error message to\nbe displayed only for deals from the NA and MEA regions. Accordingly, we can do the following:\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/validation-rules/articles/create-validation-rules\na. Click the More icon and then click Edit.\nb. In the Which records would you like to apply the rule to? pop-up, select Choose based on specific\nconditions.\nc. Define the criteria as needed.\nIf you wish, you can drill down to select exactly the records you need by adding more criteria using\nthe + button.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/validation-rules/articles/create-validation-rules\nd. Click Done.\ne. Click + if you want to add another secondary condition and repeat the previous steps to configure it.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/validation-rules/articles/create-validation-rules\n11. Click Add another option to add another primary condition.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/validation-rules/articles/create-validation-rules\n12. A fully completed validation rule will look something like this:\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/validation-rules/articles/create-validation-rules\n13. Click Save (at the top-right of your screen). You've successfully created your validation rule.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/validation-rules/articles/create-validation-rules\nTo edit a validation rule\n1. Go to Setup > Customization > Modules and Fields.\n2. Select the module for which you want to create the validation rule.\n3. In the [Module] page, click the Validation Rules tab.\n4. Click the validation rule that you want to edit.\n5. Make changes in the validation rule editor and click Save.\nTo deactivate a validation rule\nNote\nIf a field, used in primary or secondary conditions, is updated via a workflow rule, Blueprint,\nAPI, import, or webform, this field update will take precedence. This means that the validation\nrule will be overwritten by the field update. As a consequence, CRM will accept the value\nentered as a result of the field update over the validation rule. Learn more about the consequences\nof this here.\nIn cases where you've created both a validation rule and a Blueprint validation for the same field\nand both have different conditions, the Blueprint validation will override the validation rule. This is\ntrue as long as the record is within a blueprint to which the Blueprint validation is applicable. When\na record has exited a process, the validation rule is then effective.\nIf records generated via webforms meet the validation rule criteria, they'll be submitted for manual\nrecord approval.\nBelow are the numbers of conditions allowed within a validation rule:\n10 primary conditions per rule\nFive secondary conditions per primary condition\nFive criteria per secondary condition\nValidation rules aren't supported for multi-select lookups, multi-picklists, multi-user field, formula\nfields, auto-number fields, image upload fields, and multi-line fields.\nYou can validate images using Zia. To learn more, see Zia Vision.\nValidation rules are supported in the following areas:\nCreate (web version)\nQuick create (web version)\nEdit (web version)\nQuick edit (Ajax, web version)\nConvert (single and mass)\nKanban view\nCopy customization\nSandbox\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/validation-rules/articles/create-validation-rules\n1.

They use\nCRM to maintain sales and after-sales data of their customers. Whenever they receive a post-sale inspection\nrequest, they want the field agent to visit the client's location, survey the damages sustained to the appliance and\nmake a note of the same via the Notes feature. To make the Notes more accessible, they have created a custom\nbutton called\u00a0 Send Notes and have placed this on the detail view page for every contact.\u00a0 When a field agent\npushes this button, the updated Notes will be sent as an email to their managers.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/custom-links-and-buttons/articles/custom-buttons\nNow, along with the updated notes, they can also obtain information about the location where this button was\nexecuted. This location information will be useful for various needs such as computing rewards for the agents\nbased on the number of field visits made to \u00a0handling customer tickets and disputes.\u00a0\nThat said, it is understandable if users of the button have privacy concerns. Once this button is enabled, whenever\nan agent pushes this button on the mobile app, a consent popup will open, requesting the user's permission to\nshare location information. They can proceed to execute the button by allowing or denying this request.\nIf they do not wish to share location information, they can just execute\nthe button without sharing location details, as such.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/custom-links-and-buttons/articles/custom-buttons\nThis consent popup will appear on both iOS and Android apps of Zoho CRM.\u00a0\nIf the mobile app user hasn't enabled location services on their phone, Zoho CRM will first prompt\nthem to turn on location services on their device and then subsequently request consent for tracking\ntheir location via the custom button.\u00a0\nThis consent popup is designed to appear only for the mobile application of Zoho CRM and not the\nweb version.\u00a0\nThe Location option will be shown only for \"Functions\"(ie., From Gallery, From Existing Actions,\nWriting functions) in Custom button.\nLocation option is not supported for \"Custom Actions\".\nLocation option will be shown for Create/Clone Page, Edit Page, View Page and Related List and is\nnot supported for list view options and Wizards.\n", "source": "custom-buttons.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "dealing-with-bounce-warnings", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-capabilities/articles/dealing-with-bounce-warnings\nZoho Corporation\nEmail bounce management\nA bounce warning indicates that one or more of your emails have been rejected by the recipient's email server.\nThis can be caused by a variety of factors, including an invalid email address, a full mailbox, or a blocked\ndomain. It's important to understand the cause of the bounce and take steps to prevent it from happening again.\nThis may include updating your contact list to remove invalid email addresses, ensuring that your emails are not\nmarked as spam, and avoiding sending too many emails in a short period of time. Additionally, Zoho CRM\nprovides tools to help you monitor your bounce rate and take corrective action. With these tools, you can quickly\nidentify and address any issues that may be causing your emails to bounce.\nRead further to learn more about how you can avoid email bounces.\nAvoiding email bounces\u00a0\nYour emails can bounce for multiple reasons. Depending on the reason, bounces can be broadly classified into\nhard bounces and soft bounces.\nEmail addresses are classified as hard bounces when Zoho CRM determines that emails cannot be delivered\npermanently to those addresses. Consequently, these email addresses will be blocked, preventing any future\nemail from Zoho CRM.\nEmail addresses are classified as soft bounces when Zoho CRM determines that emails cannot be\ntemporarily delivered to those addresses.\nIn Zoho CRM, email bounces are divided into two types: Temporary and Permanent. Temporary bounces include\nsoft bounces and certain types of hard bounces. If an email address is temporarily blocked, you can unblock it\ndirectly. However, hard bounces are usually permanent and cannot be unblocked within CRM.\nIf you believe that a permanently bounced email address is now deliverable, you can seek assistance from our\nsupport team\u00a0at support@zohocrm.com with relevant details and we will take necessary measures to whitelist\nZoho CRM.\nChecking details for bounced email addresses\nWatching out for a high bounce rate\u00a0 \u00a0\nThe \"Bounce rate\" refers to the percentage of email recipients who did not receive the emails you sent to\nthem. Although a small number of bounces are to be expected in bulk emailing, a warning will be issued\nwhen the bounce rate crosses a certain limit. To set a benchmark, a bounce rate under 5% in Zoho CRM is\nacceptable. Anything more than that needs to be attended to immediately.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-capabilities/articles/dealing-with-bounce-warnings\nYou can find the details of the bounce type and category for email addresses that bounced in the following\nsections of your CRM:\nRecord Details page\nIf an email address in the record details page bounces, a warning icon will be displayed. Hover over the\nwarning icon to view the details regarding the bounce category.\nEmail Related list\nIf an email is unable to be delivered, the email related list will display its status along with information\nabout the type of bounce.\nModule view/List view\nWhen you apply the filter to the blocked email field on the module view/list view page of records, you will\nsee similar warning icons for the different bounce types.\u00a0\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-capabilities/articles/dealing-with-bounce-warnings\nUnderstanding the different types and categories of bounce\u00a0\nThe following table presents various bounce warning messages that may be encountered for blocked email\naddresses.

We recommend that you contact the\nrecipient and ask them to free up some storage. You can\nalso verify if the emails you have sent to them contain any\nlarge attachments that you could do without.\nTemporary Network\nError\n\u00a0\nYour email relay\nserver has failed to\nsend the email to the\nintended mailbox.\nRelaying refers to the process of transferring emails from\none mail server to another to deliver them to the recipient.\nIf there are any issues while performing this action via\nemail relay servers you have set up within Zoho CRM,\nthen the email could bounce citing 'Temporary network\nerror' as the reason. We recommend that you troubleshoot\nyour configured email relay server, and also reach out to\nthe recipient to ask if their email providers, domains, or\ninternal systems have recently gone through any major\nchanges or disruptions.\nContent related\nThis email has been\nmarked as spam by\nthe recipient's email\nserver.\nWhen an email has been flagged manually as spam by\nyour recipient, or if it is automatically being filtered out\nby the spam filters of your recipient's server, then those\nemails could bounce citing 'Content related' as the reason.\nWe recommend that you check your email for reasons\nwhy it could have been marked as spam. This includes the\ncontent you send, the URLs in your email, the type of\nattachments you are trying to send, and so on. Also,\nensure that you have authenticated the domains connected\nto your email addresses, via SPF, DKIM, or both via Zoho\nCRM, to reduce the possibility of your emails landing in\nspam.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-capabilities/articles/dealing-with-bounce-warnings\nOthers\nThe recipient's\nmailbox is not\nreachable due to\nunknown reasons.\nWhen an email bounce reason does not fall into any of the\nabove-listed categories, it will be marked as 'Others'. One\nof the possible solutions is to ask your recipient's\norganization to whitelist the IP addresses your Zoho CRM\naccount uses to send emails. This includes the default IP\naddresses, as shown in the section below, but could also\ninclude your IP addresses if you have set up email relay\nservers.\nWe recommend that you resolve the issue with your\nrecipients before unblocking them inside Zoho CRM for\nfuture email sending.

Make sure you check the following points while you import a list:\nIn your import sheet, find and remove any additional characters in the Email address field, such as\ncommas, quotation marks, spaces, and so on.\nMake sure each column is titled correctly, after the respective field names. For example, First\nName, Last Name, Email Address, and so on.\nAvoid sending emails to old and stale email lists\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOne of the most common reasons for email bounces could be that your contact list is outdated.\nWhen we say \"stale list\", it could mean any of the following:\nThe email addresses are no longer valid\nThe contacts have not been getting emails from you for a long period\u00a0(say more than six months).\nYour leads and contacts changed their email address a while back.\nYour contacts have not been using their email account for too long, so the account has stopped\nworking and started returning bounces.\nThe recipient email domains have expired.\nIn any of these cases, there is a good chance for your emails to bounce. It's good practice to check and\nupdate the list of leads and contacts at regular intervals. If it's been too long since you sent a batch of\nemails, reconfirm your contact list before you send another set of emails.\nAvoid using a public domain address as your \"From\" address\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nYour emails are very likely to bounce if you have been using a public webmail address as your \"From\"\naddress.\nFree web domains do have strict policies to avoid spam. However, when you use such an email address to\nsend your emails\u00a0via Zoho CRM, your emails are very likely to bounce. For example, if you send emails\nvia Zoho CRM using example-id@yahoo.com, the receiving servers will identify that the email is not\ndirectly from Yahoo, but via another platform. In this case, the servers may reject the emails, resulting in\nan email bounce.\nFor this reason, we strongly recommend that you use your own private domain-based email address in\nZoho CRM to send mass emails to customers.\nid b\ni\nil dd\nf\nill\ni i\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-capabilities/articles/dealing-with-bounce-warnings\nAvoid buying email addresses from illegitimate sources\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIf the email addresses of your leads and contacts have been collected at different points in time from\nuntrustworthy sources, they are likely fake or invalid. It is better not to send to bought or harvested lists.\nIt is highly recommended that you verify and confirm the interest of your leads and contacts in receiving\nthe emails before you send bulk emails to them.\nRemove invalid email address\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTo make sure your contact lists do not become obsolete, ensure that you verify the email addresses at\nregular intervals. Over time, it is likely that some email addresses shutdown due to prolonged inactivity\nand become invalid. Make sure to delete such invalid email addresses.\nTo check your email bounces, Zoho CRM offers you an Email Bounce report by default.

Companies often\nuse different domains to deliver the message to its recipients. In such cases, it's crucial to\u00a0establish an email policy\nthat can define the rules by which the email source can be authenticated.\nZoho CRM provides email authentication standards that allows the organizations to increase the trustworthiness\nof an email's origin when they choose to send emails from Zoho CRM using their domain. To authenticate your\nemails sent from Zoho CRM, you need to validate the following authentication standards:\nDomain Verification\nDKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)\nAdditionally, validating\u00a0SPF (Sender Policy Framework) is also recommended.\nAvailability\nEmail Authentication\nAuthenticating the email source consists of the following steps:\nStep 1. Add your company's domain or subdomain\nAdding your company's domains or subdomains is the first step for email authentication. Domain verification\nhelps to ensure that the domain from which the emails are sent is authentic and trustworthy. To facilitate this, you\nhave to add your company's email address and the domains or subdomains in Zoho CRM.\nImportant: Authenticate your Zoho CRM account's email-sending domains to send emails from your\nown email addresses, and to improve deliverability. Email addresses connected to non-authenticated\ndomains cannot be used and will be auto-replaced in all your outgoing emails with Zoho CRM's own\nauthenticated domains.

Verify the domain details\nOnce you add the domain, a verification code is generated and sent to the email address that should be entered to\nverify the domain details. The verification email is valid for 15 days, in case you do not receive an email or you\nhave exhausted the validity period, you can use the\u00a0Resend Mail\u00a0link.\nStep 3. Validate the records\nOnce the domain and subdomains details are verified, you need to add DKIM (Required) and SPF\n(Recommended) records in your DNS settings.\nDKIM\u00a0-\u00a0DKIM is used to ensure that the message has not been altered in transmission.\u00a0It uses public key\nencryption to authenticate the email messages. It is mandatory to add DKIM records in your domain's DNS\nsettings to have better email deliverability.\u00a0See Also\u00a0DKIM Configuration\nSPF\u00a0- This authentication standard allows sending domains to define which IP addresses are allowed to deliver\nemail messages on behalf of the domain.\u00a0In addition to DKIM, we recommend that you add SPF records to your\ndomain to provide further security against spoofing attacks and helps prevent emails from your domain being\nmarked as spam.\u00a0See Also\u00a0SPF Configuration\nAdd Your Company's Domain\nTo add your company's domain\n1.

If a\ndomain is authenticated via another Zoho service, this will be indicated next to the domain's\nauthentication status.\nAuthenticated domains are identified automatically every 48 hours.\nDomains authenticated outside Zoho CRM within this period will update their status within 48\nhours.\nThis feature requires at least one domain to be authenticated in Zoho CRM via SPF or DKIM to\ninitiate the automatic process.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-configuration/articles/email-authentication\nDMARC\nMass emails and emails sent from the organizational email address are always sent from Zoho's\nserver.\nAnother authentication standard that the sending domains use to block fraudulent emails is\nDMARC (Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance). It's built as a\ncombination of the DKIM and SPF standards with additional features like reporting, policy\ndefinition, and the notion of identity alignment. DMARC requires either DKIM or SPF alignment.\nSo if you complete DKIM authentication as required by Zoho CRM, your domain will meet the\nDMARC standard.\nThe CRM will check the DMARC policy for each domain used within the system. If a DMARC\npolicy is set, it will be indicated by showing a \"DMARC set\" tag alongside the domain name. If\nnot, it will show \"No DMARC.\" Learn more about DMARC.\nHovering over the \"DMARC set\" label will display the policy value, which can be \"p=reject,\"\n\"quarantine,\" or \"none.\" The minimum requirement from Google or Yahoo is that domains have at\nleast \"none\" as the value. DMARC is another type of protocol similar to SPF DKIM.\nIf DMARC is not set, you'll be prompted to set up DMARC for that particular domain when sending mass\nemails.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-configuration/articles/email-authentication\nSEE ALSO\nAdditionally, under Recommended actions in the Email Credibility Report, you'll find details on the\nnumber of email sending domains that are pending DMARC.\nTroubleshooting Tips\nCheck out our troubleshooting tips on Email Authentication\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/email-configuration/articles/email-authentication\nEmail Limits\nSending Mass Emails\nEmail Insights\nUsing BCC Dropbox\n", "source": "email-authentication.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "data-security-types", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/data-security-types/articles/data-security-types\nZoho Corporation\nData Security Types - An Overview\nManaging the complexities of security administration is one of the growing concerns in any enterprise, especially\nthose open to e-commerce or with large networks.

They offer a direct and effective way to convey tailored\nmessages to specific audiences, which is essential for maintaining connections and ensuring that the right\ninformation reaches the right people. However, the success of this communication largely hinges on something\ncalled email deliverability.\nEmail deliverability refers to the likelihood of your email successfully landing in the recipient's primary inbox,\nrather than getting sidetracked to a spam folder or bouncing back undelivered. For example, imagine a company\nlaunching a new product and sending out announcements via email. If they have a 90% delivery rate, it means 90\nout of every 100 emails successfully reach a recipient's mailbox. However, delivery doesn't guarantee visibility. If\n30 of these emails end up in the spam folder, only 60% are truly placed where intended, reducing the effectiveness\nof the campaign.\nIn simpler terms, good email deliverability means that your emails not only reach your audience, but do so in a\nway that they are seen and read. Problems like messages being marked as spam, delayed, or blocked indicate that\nthere are mismatches between your emailing practices and what email providers expect. Understanding and\noptimizing email deliverability can significantly enhance how your messages are received and acted upon.\nIn the context of Customer Relationship Management (CRM), understanding the distinction between email\ndelivery and email deliverability is crucial for executing effective promotional emails and maintaining strong\ncustomer communications.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/emails-deliverability/articles/emails-deliverability-in-zoho-crm\nDifferences between email delivery and email deliverability\nUnderstanding the distinction between email delivery and email deliverability is crucial for executing effective\nemail communication and maintaining strong customer communications. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the differences:\nEmail Delivery:\nDefinition: Email delivery refers to the process of your email successfully being sent from your server and\naccepted by the recipient's email server. It simply measures whether the email was rejected or accepted by the\nrecipient\u2019s server.\nMetric: The primary metric here is the delivery rate, which is the percentage of emails sent that do not bounce\nback or get rejected by the recipient\u2019s email server.\nFocus: The focus is on the initial hurdle of getting the email to the recipient\u2019s server, not on where the email ends\nup once it is there.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/emails-deliverability/articles/emails-deliverability-in-zoho-crm\nEmail Deliverability:\u00a0\nDefinition: Email deliverability, on the other hand, is about ensuring that your emails not only reach the server\nbut also successfully land in the recipient's inbox, avoiding filters that might route them to the spam folder or\nother less visible parts of the mailbox.\nMetric: Key metrics for deliverability include the inbox placement rate and the spam percentage. These measure\nhow often your emails make it to the inbox versus being diverted to spam or other folders.\nFocus: Deliverability is focused on the quality of your engagement and reputation, considering factors like sender\nreputation, content relevance, and recipient interaction, which influence whether an email is sorted into the inbox\nor a spam folder.\nIn practical terms, consider a CRM system used by a sales team:\nIf a salesperson sends out 100 emails and 95 are accepted by the servers (not bounced or rejected), the email\ndelivery rate would be 95%.\nAchieving high email delivery is a basic requirement, but optimizing email deliverability is crucial for the actual\neffectiveness of email campaigns within a CRM strategy. It ensures that the emails not only reach the server, but\nalso achieve the desired visibility and interaction with the customers.\nImportance of email deliverability\nEmail deliverability is a vital component in the effective use of CRM systems, particularly for sales and marketing\nefforts. It goes beyond merely sending out emails\u2014it ensures that these communications actually reach and\nengage customers in meaningful ways.\nHere\u2019s why email deliverability is so crucial:\u00a0\nDirect Impact on Revenue: The ability of sales teams to close deals and generate revenue heavily depends\non their communication with prospects and customers. If emails do not reach the inbox, the initial step in\ncustomer engagement is lost. Poor deliverability can lead to a stagnant and unresponsive mailing list,\ndiminishing the potential for sales conversions and, consequently, leading to potential revenue losses.\nEffective email communication is not just about sending out messages; it's about making sure these\nmessages are seen and acted upon.\nCustomer Engagement and Retention:\u00a0CRM systems thrive on continuous interaction and nurturing of\ncustomer relationships. If emails are misrouted to spam folders or fail to be delivered, the opportunity to\nengage and retain customers diminishes. Regular and reliable communication via email can help in keeping\nyour brand top of your audience's meind, educating customers about new products, and providing them\nvalue through tailored content, all of which are crucial for long-term retention.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/emails-deliverability/articles/emails-deliverability-in-zoho-crm\nReputation Management:\u00a0Email deliverability is closely tied to the sender's reputation. Internet Service\nProviders (ISPs) track how recipients interact with your emails; frequent rejections or a high volume of\nemails marked as spam can damage your reputation. A tarnished reputation can lead to lower deliverability\nrates over time, affecting all future email communications. Maintaining a good sender reputation ensures\nthat emails are more likely to be delivered to the inbox.\nResource Efficiency: Sales teams often lack the time to focus on optimizing email strategies due to the\nhigh demands of their roles. Poor deliverability can mean that even well-crafted emails become futile\nefforts, wasting valuable resources. Implementing systems and strategies that enhance deliverability ensures\nthat the time and effort invested in crafting these communications are not wasted.\nData Accuracy and CRM Effectiveness:\u00a0Email interactions provide valuable data that CRM systems use\nto analyze customer behavior, segment audiences, and personalize future communications. If emails do not\nreach the intended recipients, the data collected will be skewed, potentially leading to misguided strategies\nand decisions. Ensuring high deliverability rates means more accurate data, leading to more effective CRM\ninitiatives.\n\u00a0\nIn summary, ensuring effective email deliverability is not just a technical requirement\u2014it's a strategic imperative\nthat directly impacts the effectiveness of communication, customer relationship management, and ultimately,\nbusiness profitability.\nFactors that affect deliverability\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSender reputation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSender reputation is essentially a score given by ISPs that affects whether your emails reach the inbox or get\nsidelined into the spam folder. It\u2019s influenced by factors such as the volume of emails you send, the number of\ncomplaints those emails generate, the frequency with which your emails hit spam traps, the rate of emails sent to\ninvalid addresses, and the overall engagement (like opens and clicks) that your emails receive.\nA poor sender reputation means ISPs are more likely to filter your emails into spam, drastically reducing their\neffectiveness. To improve your sender reputation, you should regularly clean your email lists, encourage recipient\nengagement, manage how many emails you send at a time, monitor for spam complaints, and use email\nauthentication methods like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. Implementing these practices will help ensure your emails\nare more likely to land in inboxes, maintaining effective communication and boosting your sales promotion\nresults.\nZoho CRM has implemented several features aimed at improving sender reputation through enhancing\nemail credibility.\nEmail Credibility Dashboard:\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/emails-deliverability/articles/emails-deliverability-in-zoho-crm\nZoho CRM includes an email credibility dashboard that allows administrators to closely monitor and analyze their\norganization's email practices. This dashboard provides vital statistics, such as the email bounce rate and spam\ncomplaint rate, which are crucial for maintaining a healthy sender reputation.\nFeatures of the Email Credibility Dashboard:\nCredibility Score and Recommendations: Each organization using Zoho CRM is assigned an email\ncredibility score. This score reflects the effectiveness of their email practices based on metrics like response\nrates, bounce rates, and spam complaints.\nThe dashboard not only displays this score, but also offers recommended actions to improve it. These\nrecommendations are tailored based on the observed email sending behaviors and outcomes.\nBounce Report:\u00a0The bounce report within Zoho CRM shows the total number of emails sent versus the\nnumber that bounced. This report can be customized for specific duration and for individual users, helping\nto pinpoint areas needing attention.\nBy analyzing these bounce reports, users can identify and rectify issues that may be harming their sender\nreputation, such as problems with email addresses or content triggering spam filters.\nCredibility Score Trend Report: This report tracks the credibility score over time, comparing it against\nmetrics like email volume and bounce rates.\nObserving trends in the credibility score helps in understanding whether improvements are being made and\nwhich practices are yielding positive results.\nShared Email-Sending Infrastructure:\nZoho CRM uses a shared infrastructure to send emails, making it essential for all organizations using the platform\nto maintain high email credibility. If one organization's practices lead to a poor reputation, it could negatively\naffect others on the same infrastructure. Maintaining high standards is beneficial for all users of the platform.\nBy offering these tools and insights, Zoho CRM helps organizations not only monitor but actively improve their\nemail sending practices, thereby enhancing their overall sender reputation. This proactive approach ensures more\neffective email communication, leading to better engagement and results from emails.\nLearn more about email credibility in Zoho CRM.\n\u00a0\nEmail authentication\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPlease note that we will block the email sending if the bounce percentage goes over 15%, and it's\nimportant to regulate that periodically.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/emails-deliverability/articles/emails-deliverability-in-zoho-crm\nOrganizations often use multiple email domains to communicate with recipients. Ensuring these email addresses\nare authentic is crucial to maintaining trust and security. Email authentication is a process used by email servers to\nconfirm that the emails are indeed coming from the claimed sources and have not been tampered with during\ntransmission. This requires both sending and receiving servers to coordinate using established standards.\nEmail Authentication Standards:\nSender Policy Framework (SPF):\u00a0This standard ensures that the sender's server is authorized to send\nemails for the domain. Without an SPF record, emails may be rejected, since they could appear to originate\nfrom potentially malicious sources.\nDomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM): DKIM uses a public key encryption to ensure that the content of\nthe email remains unaltered during its journey. This helps to prevent email forgery.\nDomain Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC): This method combines\nelements of SPF and DKIM and adds an extra layer of security, giving senders more control over their\nemails and how they are handled.\u00a0\nLet's imagine a sales team using a CRM system like Zoho CRM to manage communications with prospects. The\nCRM ensures that all emails sent are authenticated via SPF and DKIM. This reduces the risk of emails being\nmarked as spam and improves deliverability. For example, if a sales rep sends an offer email without proper\nauthentication, the email might end up in the spam folder or, worse, get the company's IP address blacklisted.\nProper use of SPF, DKIM, and DMARC can prevent such issues, ensuring emails reach their intended recipients\nand ultimately, enhancing return on investment (ROI) from email promotions.\nUtilizing these email authentication standards is essential for securing email communications, maintaining a good\nsender reputation, and avoiding potential blacklisting by ISPs. This, in turn, ensures better email deliverability and\nstronger engagement with customers.\nLearn more about how email authentication works in Zoho CRM.\nSteps taken by Zoho CRM to authenticate domains and ensuring\ndeliverability\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWe recognize the challenges sales teams face in balancing ensuring email deliverability with increasing\nconversions. Zoho CRM supports these efforts with several features designed to enhance deliverability.\nUsing public or free email domains like Gmail or Yahoo for business communications often leads to increased\nscrutiny by email providers, which can negatively affect delivery rates. To counter this, Zoho CRM automatically\nupgrades emails sent from such addresses to use Zoho's authenticated domain addresses, boosting the chances that\nthese emails reach their intended recipients.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/emails-deliverability/articles/emails-deliverability-in-zoho-crm\nFor businesses utilizing custom domains (e.g., xyz@zylker.com), Zoho CRM allows emails to be sent from these\naddresses without modification, provided they are authenticated within Zoho CRM. If a custom domain is not\nauthenticated, Zoho CRM will substitute the sender's address with one from its own authenticated domain to\nensure email delivery. This practice not only preserves sender reputation, but is crucial given Zoho CRM's use of\na shared email infrastructure. It ensures that unauthenticated domains do not compromise the deliverability for\nothers using the same system. This approach safeguards the integrity and effectiveness of your email\ncommunications.\n\u00a0\nEmail content\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe quality and presentation of your email content play a significant role in how both recipients and email\nproviders perceive your messages. Poorly formatted emails or those with coding errors, such as open-ended\nHTML tags, are often marked as spam by email providers.\nTo prevent your emails from being flagged and sent to the spam folder, it's essential to use legitimate and\nthoroughly vetted URLs. URLs that look suspicious or are overly brief are likely to activate spam filters. This is\nparticularly important for sales teams aiming for fast conversions\u2014they must ensure that their emails don\u2019t appear\ndeceptive or spam-like.\nFurthermore, the tone and wording of your emails should be carefully chosen to avoid sounding too urgent or\nspammy. Upholding high content standards not only improves your chances of emails being delivered\nsuccessfully but also builds a more engaged and responsive mailing list. This strategic focus on content quality\nfacilitates more meaningful interactions and enhances communication with your audience.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTips and tricks to ensure deliverability\u00a0\nImproving email deliverability is crucial for effective communication and ensuring your messages reach the\nintended recipients' inboxes.\nEmail deliverability can be improved by following these tips and trick:\n1. Maintain a Clean Contact List:\nNote:\nTo authenticate your custom domains and to use them for sending emails via Zoho CRM, you can\nfollow the steps in this\u00a0help document.\nThe mentioned email deliverability changes do not apply when users send emails through their\nconfigured mailbox or when an email relay server is setup for an account.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/emails-deliverability/articles/emails-deliverability-in-zoho-crm\nAvoid Purchasing Contacts: Never buy third-party contact lists, as these often include unengaged\nusers who can hurt your sender reputation.\nUse Double Opt-In: Confirm subscriber interest through a double opt-in process. This ensures that\nonly engaged users receive your emails, which improves open rates and reduces spam complaints.\nRegularly Update and Clean Your List: Remove bounced and unresponsive email addresses to keep\nyour list fresh and engaged.\nSegment audiences to ensure content relevance, which can improve engagement and decrease the\nlikelihood of emails being marked as spam.\n2. Authentication and Domain Management:\nUse a Custom Domain: Avoid using public email addresses (like those from Gmail or Yahoo) for\nbusiness communications. A custom domain enhances credibility.\nAuthenticate Your Domain: Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to verify your domain and\nemail integrity, reducing the likelihood of being flagged as spam.\nRegister with BIMI: Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) associates your logo with\nyour email, boosting trust and potentially increasing open rates.\nLearn more about BIMI for email authentication.\n3. Email Content and Design:\nOptimize Email Templates: Ensure your templates are responsive and consistent across all devices\nand email clients.\nPersonalize Your Content: Tailored content resonates better with recipients and shows engagement\nthat improves deliverability.\nUse Clear and Concise Language: Convey messages in fewer sentences to keep the reader's\nattention.\nAvoid Overusing Rich Media: Excessive use of images or rich media can trigger spam filters. Keep\nthe text-to-image ratio balanced.\nRefrain from Attachments in Initial Emails: Attachments in cold emails can look suspicious and\noften get flagged by email providers.\nLimit Use of Spam Trigger Keywords: Words like \"free,\" \"guarantee,\" and excessive use of dollar\nsigns or all caps can activate spam filters.\nAvoid Exclamation Points: These can appear aggressive or spammy, reducing the professionalism of\nyour email.\n4. Sending Practices:\nMonitor Send Frequency: Too many emails can annoy recipients and lead to high unsubscribe rates;\ntoo few can make them forget you.\nAvoid Stale Contacts: Regularly refresh your list to remove those who haven't engaged with your\nemails over an extended period.\nUse a Recognizable Sender Name: This helps recipients identify who the email is from, improving\nopen rates.\nObtain Explicit Consent: Always get permission before adding someone to your mailing list to\ncomply with anti-spam laws and improve engagement.\nProvide an Unsubscribe Option: Make it easy for subscribers to opt out if they no longer wish to\nreceive communications.\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/connect-with-customers/email/emails-deliverability/articles/emails-deliverability-in-zoho-crm\n5. Legal Compliance and Feedback:\nAdhere to Anti-Spam Laws: Ensure all emails comply with local regulations like GDPR, CAN-\nSPAM, or CASL.\nUse Feedback Loops: Signing up for feedback loops with ISPs lets you know when recipients mark\nyour email as spam, allowing you to refine your list. For example, Yahoo feedback loop.\nInclude Essential Information: Always include your physical address in the footer of your emails to\ncomply with anti-spam laws and add authenticity.\n6. Testing and Monitoring:\nUse Deliverability Testing Tools: Tools like Mailtrap.io and Spamcheck help you test whether your\nemails will end up in spam and allow you to troubleshoot issues before sending to your main list.\nBy implementing these practices, organizations can significantly enhance their email deliverability, ensuring their\ncommunications are seen and engaged with by their intended audiences.\u00a0\u00a0\n", "source": "emails-deliverability-in-zoho-crm.pdf"}, {"doc_id": "elements-of-a-kiosk", "text": "https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/kiosk/articles/elements-of-a-kiosk\nZoho Corporation\nElements of a kiosk\nYou can build kiosks to cover multiple use cases, but in the end, they are all made up of a few basic elements that\nare added, configured, and connected in multiple ways.\nThese basic elements are:\nScreen\nDecision\nAction\nLet's look at them one by one.\nScreen\nhttps://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/customize-crm-account/kiosk/articles/elements-of-a-kiosk\nA screen presents the user with display text, fields, data from the CRM, data collected from previous screens, and\nbuttons to pick the next step.
